Hey there. Looks like you want to contribute with an issue. Great. Here's what you have to do:
* Have a look through the [Botania FAQ](http://vazkii.us/mod/Botania/faq.php), to see if your issue has been solved already;
* Read through the steps on [Bug Reporting 101](http://vazkii.us/br101/);
* Note the following points:
  * Issues regarding MCPC+/Cauldron that are not reproducible with forge only are **not accepted**;
  * Issues regarding outdated versions of the mod are **not accepted**;
  * Unless you manually update every mod on the pack to the latest, issues regarding the direwolf20 modpack are  **not accepted**;
  * Duplicate issues or issues that have been solved already (use the search feature!) will be closed without asking.
  * Do not tag your issues' names. "Something Broke" is prefered to "[Bug] Something Broke"  because there's a proper label system in place.
  * Post suggestions or ideas on reddit or the forums. This is for bugs, not ideas.

The following *bugs* are not accepted:
* Intended Behaviour
  * The e in Excaliber
  * Double tall flowers need be harvested with shears to not clutter the inventory
* Already fixed but people keep reporting it for some reason
  * Wearing a Ring of Loki or Ring of the Aesir shows a wireframe below bedrock
* Not a botania problem/Not fixable
  * Crash on startup with ChromatiCraft is installed (update CC) 
  * Crash on opening the Lexica Botania with Enchiridion installed (update Enchiridion)
  * Flowers don't render (Optifine issue)
  * Mana Bursts get destroyed on Cauldron by the ClearLagg plugin (add botania:manaBurst to the ClearLagg blacklist)
  * Force Relays destroy blocks when used very fast (Can't fix due to the nature of the block)
  * Terrasteel crafting won't start (make sure your checkerboard is correct, there's Livingrock under the plate)
