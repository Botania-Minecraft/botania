botania.page.lexicon3=Any entries typed in &oItalics&r are &4basic&0 entries, which contain the very basic knowledge required to playing Botania. They should be prioritized over others, most of the sections contain one or more, so a good look through through them is a good idea.
botania.page.lexicon1=&1보타니아 사전&0 조합법.

# -- MYSTICAL FLOWERS
botania.entry.flowers=Mystical Flowers
botania.page.flowers0=Around the world, you may stumble upon a large variety of Mystical Flora. Spotting these doesn't take much work as the flowers themselves emit a fair amount of shine.<br>They come in a total of &416 &0different colors.<br>It's also possible to grow these flowers using &1Floral Fertlizer&0 (read on).
botania.page.flowers1=Flowers as far as the eye can see...
botania.page.flowers2=These flowers can be plucked for &1Mystical Petals&0, that can be used for making magical instruments and plants alike.<br>Right clicking a petal on the ground will &4bury it&0, having it emit particles.<br>These petals can also be crushed into &1Floral Powder&0, which functions much alike any mundane piece of dye.
botania.page.flowers3=Plucking Petals off Flowers.
botania.page.flowers4=Crafting the &1Pestle and Mortar&0.
botania.page.flowers5=Grinding Petals into Powder.
botania.page.flowers6=Right clicking the &1Floral Powder&0 in any &1Wool&0 or &1Carpet&0 changes its color to the color of the powder.<br>By mixing the &1Floral Powder&0 with some &1Bone Meal&0, it's possible to create a different type of fertilizer. The &1Floral Fertlizer&0 will grow a small amount of &1Mystical Flowers&0 in the nearby vicinity, if you ever run low on them.
botania.page.flowers7=Making fertilizer (any powder colors work)
botania.page.flowers8=Using typical flower substances also works

# -- PETAL APOTHECARY
botania.entry.apothecary=Petal Apothecary
botania.page.apothecary0=In order for a botanist to create plantlife that can do its bidding, one would need special means of infusing plants with mystical energy.<br>Luckily, the &1Petal Apothecary&0 does just that.
botania.page.apothecary1=The &1Petal Apothecary&0.
botania.page.apothecary2=This block, when placed in the world and given some water (by use of a &1Water Bucket&0), will accept any &1Mystical Petals&0 thrown at it, releasing their energies.<br>Once one has set the correct petals in, throwing some &1Seeds&0 in will finalize the proccess.<br>Tossing in the full bucket will also fill the recipient with water.
botania.page.apothecary3=Quite a few plants can be made using this method, for more information, read on the &4Functional Flora&0 and &4Generation Flora&0 sections of this Lexicon.<br>Shift-right clicking the &1Petal Apothecary&0 with an empty hand will remove the last item thrown in.<br>Lastly, tossing in &1Vines&0 also gives the block an overgrown visual.
botania.page.apothecary4=Crafting the &1Petal Apothecary&0.

# -- PURE DAISY
botania.entry.pureDaisy=Pure Daisy
botania.page.pureDaisy0=The &1Pure Daisy&0 is not only the most basic, but also the most important flower a botanist can have.<br>This flower will purify any adjacent &1Wood&0 and &1Stone&0 blocks, as seen on the next page, into their purified counterparts, &1Livingwood&0 and &1Livingrock&0, which can be used for crafting.  
botania.page.pureDaisy1=Just give it &4a minute&0 or so...
botania.page.pureDaisy2=&1Livingwood&0 can be turned into twigs
botania.page.pureDaisy3=White is bright and pure

# -- WAND OF THE FOREST
botania.entry.wand=Wand of the Forest
botania.page.wand0=The general multi-use tool for a botanist is the &1Wand of the Forest&0.<br>This wand, made by, effectively, strapping a pair of &1Mystical Petals&0 of any color to a few &1Livingwood Twigs&0, is required for a good amount of tasks.
botania.page.wand1=The wand has two modes, &4Bind Mode&0 and &4Function Mode&0. In &4Bind Mode&0 it can be shift-right clicked on a compatible block to select it. Shift-right clicking elsewhere binds the two blocks. In &4Function Mode&0 it'll simply not do that for shift-right clicking.<br>The two modes can be switched freely by shift-right clicking on air.
botania.page.wand2=If the wand isn't bound to anything, shift-right clicking a block allows it to be rotated around the axis of the side it's clicked on.<br>For example, clicking on the top of a &1Chest&0 rotates it around. Most blocks which can be rotated should work.
botania.page.wand3=The petals used determine the colors of the wand

# -- RUNIC ALTAR
botania.entry.runeAltar=Runic Altar
botania.page.runeAltar21=Runic creation is a rather important complex in the advancement of the botanical magics. First and foremost, though, this type of crafting requires a decent knowledge of &4Mana Manipulation&0. Before proceeding further, a read through the important entries (those in &oItalics&r) on that section of the &1Lexica Botania&0 might prove enlightening.
botania.page.runeAltar0=&1Runes&0 are extremely important components of complex magical devices or flora.<br>In order to create these, one would require a &1Runic Altar&0.<br>To utilize this &1Runic Altar&0, start by placing, via either a right click or simply tossing, the components to the rune you want to create.
botania.page.runeAltar1=Proceed by linking a &1Mana Spreader&0 to the altar, and right click it with a &1Wand of the Forest&0.<br>It should be apparent when the altar has received enough &4Mana&0. When that happens, just drop a piece of &1Livingrock&0 on top of it and use the wand on it again to collect your rune.
botania.page.runeAltar2=Crafting the &1Runic Altar&0.
botania.page.runeAltar3=A total of 16 &1Runes&0 exist.<br>The most basic and elementary runes are named after the &4Four Elements&0. The intermediate runes are named after the &4Four Seasons&0, and the most advanced runes are named after the &4Seven Deadly Sins&0. A separate &1Rune of Mana&0 also exists.
botania.page.runeAltar20=Sneaking and right-clicking the &1Runic Altar&0 with an empty hand while it's not accepting mana will remove the last item put into it.<br>Last but not least, attaching a &1Comparator&0 to it will emit signal strength &41&0 if the altar is accepting &4Mana&0 and signal strength &42&0 if it's ready to craft the rune.

# -- TERRASTEEL
botania.entry.terrasteel=Terrasteel
botania.page.terrasteel0=&1Terrasteel&0 is a powerful metal infused with the magic of nature.<br>Creating this metal proves to not be a short order, in order to create it, toss a &1Manasteel Ingot&0, a &1Mana Pearl&0 and a &1Mana Diamond&0 on top of an &4Active &1Beacon&0. A &1Mana Pool&0 must be present nearby, being at least half full. The infusion will create a single &1Terrasteel Ingot&0.

# -- WRAP
botania.entry.wrap=Wrap
botania.page.wrap0=It seems like the creator of this mod decided to add a weird game mechanic in the form of &1Wrap&0. I don't really know what it does, probably something bad. :/<br>What's this "Fourth Wall" you're talking about...?

# - MANA
# -- AN INTRODUCTION TO MANA
botania.entry.mIntro=An Introduction to Mana
botania.page.mIntro0=&4Mana&0 is an ethereal substance. In layman's terms, it is a form of &4mystical energy&0. Its sensorial existence is inconstant, and its color depends on the environment its put in.<br>Mastering &4Mana&0 is one of the most important skills a botanist needs to master.
botania.page.mIntro1=In order to create &4Mana&0, one would require a set of &4Generating Flowers&0 (read the respective section). This &4Mana&0 can be dispersed by utilizing &1Mana Spreaders&0 and stored in &1Mana Pools&0. &4Mana&0 can be used for a myriad of different things. For starters, it can be used for &4Functional Flowers&0 (read the respective section).
botania.page.mIntro2=To get started with mastering the art of &4Mana&0, one would start by learning how to use &1Dayblooms&0, &1Mana Spreaders&0 and &1Mana Pools&0.<br>These form a basic infrastructure for mana, which can be used for all sorts of purposes. Have a read at the &4Functional Flora&0 and &4Magical Apparatus&0 sections of this Lexicon. 

# -- MANA SPREADER
botania.entry.spreader=Mana Spreader
botania.page.spreader0=The &1Mana Spreader&0 is the most important component in manipulating &4Mana&0.<br>This is the block that allows &4Mana&0 to travel from point A to point B. When this block is placed on the ground, it'll face one of 6 basic directions. By holding shift-right on it with a &1Wand of the Forest&0, one can orient it to the opposite of where it was clicked. It can be pointed to other blocks with a wand in &4Bind Mode&0.
botania.page.spreader1=Holding a &1Wand of the Forest&0
botania.page.spreader2=The &1Mana Spreader&0 has a small internal buffer of &4Mana&0, which will get filled by nearby &4Generating Flowers&0. This buffer can be viewed by looking at the &1Spreader&0 with a &1Wand of the Forest&0, as demonstrated in the last page.<br>Note that the block needs to be right clicked with a wand to get accurate and adequate values.  
botania.page.spreader3=Holding a &1Wand of the Forest&0 displays a beam which shows where the spreader is pointing at. Hovering over it shows the target. The sparkle that's always shown is the point when &4Mana loss&0 starts to happen.<br>If the target of the spreader is a block that can contain &4Mana&0, and isn't full, the spreader will fire a &4Mana Burst&0, which will travel to the target, and pass the &4Mana&0 along to it.
botania.page.spreader4=The spreader only fires one burst at once, it'll only fire another one when the last one hits the target.<br>Furthermore, the bursts also start suffering &4mana loss&0 after a small amount of time. This can be seen in the beam, which becomes a lot thinner when this happens. There is also a small amount of &4mana loss&0 when a beam enters a spreader.
botania.page.spreader11=Applying a &4Redstone Signal&0 to the spreader will have it cease to function. Case better control is required, a &1Redstone Mana Spreader&0 is recommended, as it can fire bursts without a target block and works on redstone pulses.
botania.page.spreader5=Crafting the &1Mana Spreader&0

# -- MANA POOL
botania.entry.pool=Mana Pool
botania.page.pool0=The &1Mana Pool&0 is, simply put, a storage of &4Mana&0.<br>Mana can be inserted into it by usage of a &1Mana Spreader&0, and any adjacent &1Mana Spreaders&0 will pull mana from it to increase their internal buffer automatically.<br>Any &4Functional Flowers&0 require a nearby &1Mana Pool&0 to draw power from.
botania.page.pool9=&1Mana Pools&0 come in two varieties, a weaker, &1Diluted&0 variety which only stores a very small amount of &4Mana&0 and isn't able to infuse items, and a &1Normal&0 variety, which can store as much as a hundred times more than the dilluted one and can infuse items.<br>Whenever "Mana Pool" is refered elsewhere for scale, it refers to a normal one.
botania.page.pool1=Making a &1Dilluted Mana Pool&0.
botania.page.pool10=Infusing a normal &1Mana Pool&0
botania.page.pool2=Tossing in some resources into a normal &1Mana Pool&0 will cause them to get infused with &4Mana&0, turning them into more powerful forms.<br>A few examples are &1Iron Ingots&0 or &1Mystical Petals&0.<br>&4Mana&0 reading for this block functions like the &1Mana Spreader&0. A &1Redstone Comparator&0 can also output a signal based on the contents.
botania.page.pool8=For the artistic types, tossing any color of &1Floral Powder&0 in the pool will have it take its color, all sixteen colors are viable for decoration and/or easy labelling.
botania.page.pool3=Infusing &1Manasteel&0

# -- SPARKS
botania.entry.sparks=Sparks
botania.page.sparks0=&1Sparks&0 are interesting entities. Created from a combination of raw energy and &4Mana&0, they have the ability to be placed on top of a few specific &4Mana&0 containing or accepting blocks, mainly, &1Mana Pools&0.<br>Some blocks have the ability to harness &4Mana&0 from &1Sparks&0, but the uses for them seem rather limited right now.
botania.page.sparks1=&oholds up spork&r

# -- SPARK AUGMENTATION
botania.entry.sparkUpgrades=Spark Agumentation
botania.page.sparkUpgrades0=As it seems, &1Sparks&0 are a bit more versatile than it was known previously. A variety of &1Augments&0 can be applied to them to enhance their abilities. It's to note that Augments can only be applied to &1Sparks&0 that lie on &1Mana Pools&0.<br>A &1Spark&0 can only have a single &1Augment&0 at any given time.
botania.page.sparkUpgrades1=Starting off, the &1Dispersive Augment&0 has the &1Spark&0 use up the &4Mana&0 in the pool below, to charge any nearby players' &4Mana&0 containing items.
botania.page.sparkUpgrades2=The &1Dominant Augment&0 will have the &1Spark&0 pull any &4Mana&0 from nearby non-augmented &1Sparks'&0 pools into its own, until it's completely full.
botania.page.sparkUpgrades3=The &1Recessive Augment&0 will have the &1Spark&0 output all of the &4Mana&0 in its pool into any nearby non-augmented or Dispersive &1Sparks'&0 pools until it's completely empty.
botania.page.sparkUpgrades4=Lastly, the &1Isolated Augment&0 will prevent the &1Spark&0 from interacting with any Dominant or Recessive &1Sparks&0, but still allow it to interact with blocks that can receive their &4Mana&0 through the &1Spark&0 network.
botania.page.sparkUpgrades5=Crafting the Aguments

# -- MANA DISTRIBUTOR
botania.entry.distributor=Mana Distributor
botania.page.distributor0=Any botanist will eventually reach a point where a single &1Mana Pool&0 setup is not enough.<br>The &1Mana Distributor&0 will fix all those issues. By placing it adjacently to a few &1Mana Pools&0 on its sides, when it receives &4Mana&0 through &4Mana Bursts&0 it'll equally spread it to the adjacent pools. 
botania.page.distributor1=Crafting the distributor

# -- MANA VOID
botania.entry.manaVoid=Mana Void
botania.page.manaVoid0=The &1Mana Void&0 is, in layman's terms, the grave for &4Mana&0. Any &4Mana&0 shot into this block will simply vanish into the void, never to be seen again.<br>Placing one of these under a &1Mana Pool&0 allows the pool to always accept &4Mana&0, but disposing any it can't hold.
botania.page.manaVoid1=Crafting the void block

# -- MANA FLUXFIELD
botania.entry.rfGenerator=Mana Fluxfield
botania.page.rfGenerator0=By passing &4Mana&0 through a field of redstone energy, its state can change from a natural energy source to &4Redstone Flux&0.<br>Simply pointing a spreader at this block will have it shoot at it, converting the &4Mana&0 that lands on it into &4RF&0. It can then be pulled out with any &4RF&0 transporter.
botania.page.rfGenerator1=The bullet guys. I bit it.

# -- MANA LENSES
botania.entry.lens=Mana Lenses
botania.page.lens0=In order to upgrade the potential a &1Mana Spreader&0, one can apply &1Mana Lenses&0. The very basic mana lens does absolutely nothing.<br>Lenses can be &4dyed&0 all the 16 colors of the spectrum, or combined with a &1Mana Pearl&0 to create a &1Rainbow Lens&0. These will change the color of the burst.
botania.page.lens1=The basic lens, it doesn't do anything.
botania.page.lens2=&4Dying&0 lenses!
botania.page.lens3=&1Rainbow Lens&0 all the way
botania.page.lens4=But lenses are not only for fancy colors. One can upgrade them with all sorts of materials to create new lens which can do all sorts of effects on the &4Mana Bursts&0.<br>It's to take in mind that, if using a normal &1Mana Spreader&0, there needs to be a block that can receive &4Mana&0 at the end for the burst to fire. A &1Redstone Mana Spreader&0 is recommended for some of the lenses.
botania.page.lens5=Sometimes, though, having a single &1Mana Lens&0 in a spreader just isn't enough sometimes. By combining two lenses with a &1Slimeball&0 in a crafting table, it's possible to unite them into one, and keep the effects of both.<br>The first lens used determines the visuals (texture and color). It's to note that some combinations will not work, nor will two lenses of the same type.
botania.page.lens6=The &1Velocity Lens&0 will drastically increase the speed at which a &4Mana Burst&0 travels, but not only does the beam start to lose its &4Mana&0 a lot faster, it can also carry a bit less.
botania.page.lens7=Velocity Lens
botania.page.lens8=The &1Potency Lens&0 will double the amount of &4Mana&0 a &4Mana Burst&0 can carry, however, the beam becomes slower and after it starts to lose mana it does so at a lot faster rate.
botania.page.lens9=Potency Lens
botania.page.lens10=The &1Resistance Lens&0 will significantly increase the amount of time the &4Mana Burst&0 can go without starting to lose &4Mana&0, but it makes it a a bit slower.
botania.page.lens11=Resistance Lens
botania.page.lens12=The &1Efficiency Lens&0 will decrease the amount of time it takes for the &4Mana Burst&0 to start losing its &4Mana&0, but when that happens, it does so at a lot slower rate.
botania.page.lens13=Efficiency Lens 
botania.page.lens14=The &1Bounce Lens&0 will allow the &4Mana Burst&0 to bounce off walls, rather than dissipating on a collision.
botania.page.lens15=Bounce Lens
botania.page.lens16=The &1Gravity Lens&0 makes the &4Mana Burst&0 be attracted by the world's gravitational pull, thus moving in an arc. As compensation, it also slightly increases the time before &4Mana&0 loss starts to happen.
botania.page.lens17=Gravity Lens 
botania.page.lens18=The &1Bore Lens&0 charges the &4Mana Burst&0 with the ability to break any blocks it comes into contact with, draining its own mana to do so.
botania.page.lens19=Bore Lens 
botania.page.lens20=The &1Damaging Lens&0 charges the &4Mana Burst&0 with the power to damage any living beings it comes across, draining its own mana to do so.
botania.page.lens21=Damaging Lens
botania.page.lens22=The &1Phantom Lens&0 is an interesting one. By utilizing the &1Abstruse Platform&0 and its' properties, it's possible to make a lens that'll allow the &4Mana Burst&0 to pass through blocks. In doing so, the time it can stay without losing mana is decreased.
botania.page.lens23=Phantom Lens
botania.page.lens24=The &1Magnetizing Lens&0, as its name states, allows the &4Mana Burst&0 to magnetize, or home in, on any nearby blocks that can receive &4Mana&0. Doing so slightly decreases the speed of the burst.
botania.page.lens25=Magnetizing Lens
botania.page.lens26=The &1Entropic Lens&0 imbues the &4Mana Burst&0 with entropy, causing it to release its energy in the form of an explosion when it collides against something that can't receive &4Mana&0.
botania.page.lens27=Entropic Lens
botania.page.lens28=The &1Influence Lens&0 allows the &4Mana Burst&0 to have influence over any nearby &4dropped items&0, &4experience orbs&0 and even &4falling blocks&0, having them move in the exact same vector of motion as the burst itself.
botania.page.lens29=Influence Lens
botania.page.lens30=The &1Weight Lens&0 carries a strong burden on the &4Mana Burst&0, making any block hit by it, if there doesn't happen to be a block below it, fall, similarly to how &1Sand&0 and &1Gravel&0 do.
botania.page.lens31=Weight Lens
botania.page.lens32=The &1Kindle Lens&0 is infused with a burning spark, when it hits a block it'll set it on fire. It has the ability to both ignite and close &1Nether Portals&0. It doesn't seem to set any living beings on fire, though.
botania.page.lens33=Kindle Lens
botania.page.lens34=The &1Force Lens&0 acts as a &1Piston&0, when it hits a block that a piston can move, it'll do just so.
botania.page.lens35=Force Lens

# -- PORTABLE MANA TRANSPORT
botania.entry.manaTransport=Portable Mana Transport
botania.page.manaTransport0=While using &1Mana Spreaders&0 to transport &4Mana&0 around is all well and good, there is also a way of doing it in a different manner.<br>The &1Mana Tablet&0 is a portable object which can carry &4Mana&0 on itself.
botania.page.manaTransport1=Tossing one of these on top of a &1Mana Pool&0 will allow for transport of &4Mana&0 between one and another.<br>Shift-right clicking the &1Mana Pool&0 with a &1Wand of the Forest&0 will change in which way the &4Mana&0 flows.<br>Lastly, unlike normal items, these will never despawn when dropped on the floor.
botania.page.manaTransport2=Don't put it on your pocket, it might bend
botania.page.manaTransport3=It's also possible to indirectly access the &4Mana&0 reserves of a &1Mana Pool&0, through using a &1Mana Mirror&0, items will pull out of the pool itself.<br>To bind a mirror to a pool, one would simply &4shift right-click&0 a pool with the mirror.<br>The mirror can't put mana in or take mana out of pools in any other way.
botania.page.manaTransport4=Mirror mirror on the wall...

# -- MANA DETECTOR
botania.entry.manaDetector=Mana Detector
botania.page.manaDetector0=A device like the &1Mana Detector&0 is capable to detect when a &4Mana Burst&0 starts flowing through it (the burst doesn't dissipate on collision with this block) and provide a redstone signal when that is the case.
botania.page.manaDetector1=Crafting the detector

# -- REDSTONE MANA SPREADER
botania.entry.redstoneSpreader=Redstone Mana Spreader
botania.page.redstoneSpreader0=By combining a &1Mana Spreader&0 with a piece of &1Redstone&0, it's possible to create a &1Redstone Mana Spreader&0, which fires only when given a &4Redstone signal&0, regardless of having a block in the end to put the mana or not.<br>It's to keep in note that this doesn't let the spreader shoot a burst until the last one dissipates or is absorbed.
botania.page.redstoneSpreader1=Just add redstone

# -- MANASTAR
botania.entry.manastar=Manastar
botania.page.manastar0=The imprecise measurements of the &1Wand of the Forest&0 sometimes won't cut it for telling if you're turning a profit or loss in your &1Mana Pools&0.<br>Creating a &1Manastar&0 and placing it next to your pools will have it shine red if there's a loss or blue if there's a profit. The measurement happens every few seconds.
botania.page.manastar1=&rI'm a shooting star leaping through the skies&r.

# -- ELVEN MANA SPREADERS
botania.entry.dreamwoodSpreader=Elven Mana Spreaders
botania.page.dreamwoodSpreader0=Simply put, &1Dreamwood&0 conducts &4Mana&0 better than &1Livingwood&0. Add in some adjustments like &1Elementium&0 or &1Mana Petals&0 and what you get is a &1Mana Spreader&0 that can conduct more &4Mana&0, faster and for more time without &4Mana loss&0.<br>On the negative side, it can't be turned into a &1Redstone Mana Spreader&0.
botania.page.dreamwoodSpreader1=Better spreaders, that's it
botania.page.dreamwoodSpreader2=By combining this already powerful spreader with a &1Gaia Spirit&0 and a &1Dragonstone&0 gem, one can create an even more potent variant. The &1Gaia Spreader&0 is within the top percentage of Mana Spreaders, with pretty much upgrades all round.
botania.page.dreamwoodSpreader3=ULTRA_SPREADER

# -- PAINTSLINGER LENS
botania.entry.paintLens=Paintslinger Lens
botania.page.paintLens0=The &4Elves&0 are one crafty bunch. This lens is somewhat unique in comparison to the other lenses. The &1Paintslinger Lens&0 needs to be dyed one of the 16 colors of the spectrum to function. When it hits a colorable block (&1Wool, Stained Clay or Glass&0...) it'll turn any blocks connected, of the same type and color, into the color of the &4Mana Burst&0 itself. It seems to work with &4Sheep&0 too.
botania.page.paintLens1=A M'AIDER Stranded Girl

# - FUNCTIONAL FLOWERS
# -- AN INTRODUCTION TO FUNCTION
botania.entry.fIntro=An Introduction to Function
botania.page.fIntro0=There are various places in which the &4Mana&0 a botanist generates can be put to use, one of them is an assortment of &4Functional Flowers&0.<br>These flowers will drain &4Mana&0 from a nearby &1Mana Pool&0 into themselves, in order to do whatever task they were created for.<br>It's to note that these can't receive power directly through &1Mana Spreaders&0.
botania.page.fIntro1=All &4Functional Flowers&0, alike the &4Generating Flowers&0 contain a small buffer of &4Mana&0.<br>Standard rules for &4Mana&0 reading apply, right clicking with a &1Wand of the Forest&0 will update the mana readings.
botania.page.fIntro2=It is important to keep in mind that these flowers memorize the &1Mana Pool&0 from which they should pull &4Mana&0 out of. They'll only pull from the nearest pool present at the time of the flower being placed (or the closest placed afterward, if none was present), and none other, unless that one is removed. It can be bound to another pool with a wand in &4Bind Mode&0.
botania.page.fIntro3=Lastly, some functional flowers utilize a &1Redstone Root&0 in their creation. If they do, the flower's effect can be toggled with a redstone signal.
botania.page.fIntro4=&1Redstone Root&0 for Redstone Control

# -- JADED AMARANTHUS
botania.entry.jadedAmaranthus=Jaded Amaranthus
botania.page.jadedAmaranthus0=Everyone likes flowers right? The &1Jaded Amaranthus&0 is made just for that purpose.<br>Feeding it with &4Mana&0 from &1Mana Pools&0 will have it quickly grow new &1Mystical Flowers&0 around it, in any spots it can.
botania.page.jadedAmaranthus1=&oIt was this or clematis.&r
botania.page.jadedAmaranthus2=&oWait a minute, did you just summon a bunch of flowers in one turn?<br>Yeah, so?<br>That's against the rules, isn't it?<br>Screw the rules, I have Mana!

# -- DREADTHORNE
botania.entry.dreadthorne=Dreadthorne

# -- HEISEI DREAM
botania.entry.heiseiDream=Heisei Dream

# -- TIGERSEYE
botania.entry.tigerseye=Tigerseye
botania.page.tigerseye0=It's a known fact that &4Creepers&0 are terrified of &4cats&0.<br>The &1Tigerseye&0 exploits that very weakness, by emitting a feline aura, petrifying any nearby &4Creepers&0, preventing them from exploding. It also has the effect of making them run away from &4players&0.

# -- ORECHID
botania.entry.orechid=Orechid
botania.page.orechid0=While going mining is all good, a renewable means of getting ore is due. The &1Orechid&0 will use (a massive amount of) &4Mana&0 to generate &4ores&0 in nearby &1Stone&0 blocks.<br>The ores it generates are random, but seem to be biased towards more common ores rather than rarer ones.
botania.page.orechid1=&oLizbeth would like this flower&r.

# -- FALLEN KANADE
botania.entry.fallenKanade=Fallen Kanade
botania.page.fallenKanade0=The &1Fallen Kanade&0 is a flower with angelic properties, it'll use &4Mana&0 from nearby &4Mana Pools&0 in order to apply a regeneration effect to any &4players&0 nearby.
botania.page.fallenKanade1=&oHand Sonic, version four&r.
botania.page.fallenKanade2=&oI'll marry you. No matter what kind of sickness you have, even if you can't walk or stand, or even if you can't have kids, I'll still marry you.

# -- HOPPERHOCK
botania.entry.hopperhock=Hopperhock
botania.page.hopperhock0=The &1Hopperhock&0 will pick up items around it. Giving it &4Mana&0 is optional, but it'll increase its range.<br>Items picked up will be put in adjacent inventories (e.g. &1Chests&0). Placing &1Item Frames&0 in any of the inventories will specify which items can or can't go in them.
botania.page.hopperhock1=Any inventory which has no &1Item Frame&0 adjacent to it can accept any items, but labelled inventories will take priority.<br>The rule using to sort items can be changed by shift-right clicking the flower with a &1Wand of the Forest&0.

# -- RANNUNCARPUS
botania.entry.rannuncarpus=Rannuncarpus
botania.page.rannuncarpus0=Quite a handy flower indeed, the &1Rannuncarpus&0 will pick up any nearby blocks in dropped item form and place them in the world nearby. It, however, only places the blocks thrown at it on top of a specific block, to specify this block, place it right below the soil the flower is resting on.
botania.page.rannuncarpus1=Block items, such as &1Sugar Cane&0 will also work, but, much alike any other blocks, will only be placed in a location where they normally would be able to be placed.<br>Lastly, giving &4Mana&0 to the flower is optional, but it increases its range.

botania.page.pollidisiac0=Animals love eating, that's all they seem to do, really. An interesting behaviour they show is that they only seem to want to eat things that are fed to them.<br>The &1Pollidisiac&0 will simply do that, at the cost of some mana, any appropriate nearby food items (&1Wheat&0, &1Carrots&0, etc) will be fed to the animals, putting them in a &obetter mood&r.
botania.page.pollidisiac1=&oHell's Kitchen&r.

# -- CLAYCONIA
botania.entry.clayconia=Clayconia
botania.page.clayconia0=The &1Clayconia&0 is a simple flower, in essence. All it does is moisten nearby &1Sand&0, turning it into &1Clay&0, this process uses a decent amount of &4Mana&0, but nothing too insane.

# - GENERATING FLOWERS
# -- AN INTRODUCTION TO GENERATION
botania.entry.gIntro=An Introduction to Generation
botania.page.gIntro0=&4Generating Mana&0 should be at the top of the priorities for any botanist. Luckily there's an array of &4Generating Flowers&0 willing to do the job.<br>These flowers, as their name shows, generate &4Mana&0, both passively and actively. Unless stated otherwise, all &4Generating Flowers&0 generate &4Mana&0 passively under certain circumstances.
botania.page.gIntro1=All &4Generating Flowers&0, alike the &4Functional Flowers&0 contain a small buffer of &4Mana&0.<br>Standard rules for &4Mana&0 reading apply, right clicking with a &1Wand of the Forest&0 will update the mana readings.<br>This mana will be stored in the closest &1Mana Spreader&0 around.
botania.page.gIntro2=It is important to keep in mind that these flowers memorize the &1Mana Spreader&0 into which they should put &4Mana&0 into. They'll only store into the nearest spreader present at the time of the flower being placed (or the closest placed afterward, if none was present), and none other, unless that one is removed. It can be bound to another spreader with a wand in &4Bind Mode&0.

# -- DAYBLOOM
botania.entry.daybloom=Daybloom
botania.page.daybloom0=The &1Daybloom&0 is the most basic and rudimentary &4Generating Flower&0. Simply put, it performs a modified photosynthesis process, in order to transform sunlight into &4Mana&0.<br>The process is rather slow, about ten or a dozen of these should get the job done, for now.
botania.page.daybloom1=An interesting thing to take in note is that these flowers tend to compete among themselves for what sunlight hits an area, thus having any other of the same type adjacent to it on any of the four cardinal directions will result in diminishing returns of &4Mana&0 production.
botania.page.daybloom1a=An interesting thing to take in note is that these flowers tend to compete among themselves for what sunlight hits an area, thus having any other of the same type adjacent to it on any of the four cardinal directions will result in diminishing returns of &4Mana&0 production.<br>These flowers are not very resistant, and after some time they'll wither and die off.

Love has a cruel and bitter way of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain. (...)
botania.page.daybloom5=&oHow could it be that what you need the most can leave you feeling just like a ghost? You never want to feel so sad and lost again.

# -- ENDOFLAME
botania.entry.endoflame=Endoflame
botania.page.endoflame0=While the &1Daybloom&0 is all well and good, a botanist requires more effective means of generating &4Mana&0.<br>The &1Endoflame&0 does that exactly, it will absorb any combustible items or blocks dropped on the nearby vicinity (albeit only one at a time) and burn through them to passively generate mana while the fuel lasts.
botania.page.endoflame1=There is a small caveat though, the &1Endoflame&0 will not burn anything that returns a bi-product, an example are &1Lava Buckets&0, that have empty &1Buckets&0 as a bi-product.

# -- GOURMARYLLIS
botania.entry.gourmaryllis=Gourmaryllis
botania.page.gourmaryllis0=The &1Gourmaryllis&0 is one hungry flower. It'll eat up any food in a small area around it, and turn it into &4Mana&0.<br>There's a catch, though, it can only digest a single food at any given time, the &4Mana&0 is created when it's done. Any other food it finds, it'll also devour, but not create any mana from it.
botania.page.gourmaryllis1=The amount of time it takes to digest a delicacy depends on its nutritional value, in layman's terms, the amount of food points it restores.<br>So, a &1Steak&0 will take four seconds to digest, a &1Carrot&0 will take two, a loaf of &1Bread&0 will take two and a half, so on. 
botania.page.gourmaryllis2=The amount of &4Mana&0 created also makes use of this value, but in a way where the more nutritious the food is, the more efficient it is. For example, a single &1Steak&0 will produce more &1Mana&0 from two &1Carrots&0, both absolutely and per second.

# -- MANA ENCHANTING
botania.entry.manaEnchanting=Enchanting with Mana
botania.page.manaEnchanting0=By utilizing the magical power emitted from &1Mana Pylons&0, a structure that can enchant items with books without consuming them can be created, called the &1Mana Enchanter&0.<br>Constructing one of these requires a fair amount of space and materials alike.
botania.page.manaEnchanting1=To construct the &1Mana Enchanter&0, one requires, as well as fair amount of space, 17 &1Obsidian&0 blocks, 10 &1Mystical Flowers&0 of any color, 6 &1Mana Pylons&0 and a &1Lapis Lazuli Block&0.<br>The instructions on how to assemble this structure are in the following pages.

botania.page.manaEnchanting7=Items that are already enchanted can't be placed in the enchanter.<br>To start the enchanting, right click the enchanter with a &1Wand of the Forest&0. It'll scan the books around, and once it's done, a spell circle of sorts will appear around it, indicating the books can be safely picked up again.
botania.page.manaEnchanting8=After the enchanting begins, the enchanter will require &4Mana&0.<br>It can be fed via one of two ways, either via &4Mana Bursts&0 or nearby &1Sparks&0, by placing a &1Spark&0 on top of the enchanter. The later being much faster.
botania.page.manaEnchanting9=When enough &4Mana&0 is gathered, the enchanting process will finalize, and the enchantments will be applied to the item.<br>The amount of &4Mana&0 required depends on the rarity of the enchantments being applied, their level, and the total amount of enchantments.<br>If any book has more than one enchantment, only the first will be accounted for.
botania.page.manaEnchanting10=During the enchanting process, the item can not be removed, but it can after the process has been completed.<br>Note that if at any point, any component of the construct is removed, it'll revert to its original &1Lapis Lazuli Block&0 form.

botania.page.craftCrate1=The items go in from left to right and top to bottom (illustration further in this entry), to that, there's a special item, named the &1Crafting Placeholder&0, which, when placed in, counts as an empty slot in the recipe. This is used to allow for recipes with gaps (eg, furnace, chest, pickaxe...) to also be doable.
botania.page.craftCrate2=Creating the placeholder
botania.page.craftCrate3=To finish the recipe, one of two things can be done.<br>First off, filling every of the 9 slots with either recipe components or placeholders will instantly eject the result, the placeholders and any lefovers (e.g. buckets when making cake), this is the most straightforward method.
botania.page.craftCrate4=Right clicking the crate with a &1Wand of the Forest&0 (remember: &1Dispensers&0 can do this) will attempt at crafting with whatever is inside the crate and eject it.<br>If this fails all the items inside are simply ejected with no crafting procedure done.

botania.page.manaBlaster1=This burst is a bit different from the one fired from speaders, as it's faster, but carries only three quarters of the mana a spreader burst would. There's also a short cooldown period after firing the blaster until another burst can be shot.

botania.page.grassHorn0=Clearing out &1Tall Grass&0 by hand can definitely be a nuisance.<br>Simply blowing the &1Horn of the Wild&0 will quickly cause any nearby vegetation to uproot, leaving behind drops as if it had been broken by hand.<br>With some modifications, the horn can be modified to break leaves instead.
botania.page.grassHorn1=Crafting the horn

# -- TERRASTEEL ARMOR
botania.entry.terrasteelArmor=Terrasteel Armor
botania.page.terrasteelArmor0=Armor made out of &1Terrasteel&0, much alike the &1Manasteel&0 counterpart, can utilize &4Mana&0 from the inventory instead of taking damage.<br>This armor, however, has properties more alike &1Diamond&0 instead of &1Iron&0 and increases the wearer's health when worn.
botania.page.terrasteelArmor1=The &1Terrasteel Helmet&0
botania.page.terrasteelArmor2=The &1Terrasteel Chestplate&0
botania.page.terrasteelArmor3=The &1Terrasteel Leggings&0
botania.page.terrasteelArmor4=The &1Terrasteel Boots&0

# -- TERRA BLADE
botania.entry.terraSword=Terra Blade
botania.page.terraSword0=The &1Terra Blade&0, crafted from &1Terrasteel Ingots&0, is a sword infused with natural strength. Not only does it par with a &1Diamond Sword&0 in terms of strength and it uses &4Mana&0 from the inventory like &1Manasteel Tools&0, but when swung, there's a chance for it to create a beam that will deal as much damage as a melee hit.
botania.page.terraSword1=No Broken Hero Sword

# -- TERRA SHATTERER
botania.entry.terraPick=Terra Shatterer
botania.page.terraPick0=The &1Terra Shatterer&0 is a tool that can amass insane quantities of mana on itself, due to the amount of &1Terrasteel&0 required for its creation.<br>The tool functions very much like a &1Mana Tablet&0 by which it can amass &4Mana&0 by being tossed on a &1Mana Pool&0, it can't give the &4Mana&0 back, though, so it doesn't function as a storage method.
botania.page.terraPick1=The amount of &4Mana&0 stored on the tool defines its &4Rank&0. Ranks go as follows: &4D&0, &4C&0, &4B&0, &4A&0, &4S&0, &4SS&0. &4D&0 being the default rank.<br>The amount of &4Mana&0 required to advance from rank to rank increases as the rank does. To advance from &4D&0 to &4C&0, for example, it requires just a few seconds of exposition to a &1Mana Pool&0.
botania.page.terraPick2=To advance from rank &4C&0 to rank &4B&0, a full &1Mana Pool&0 is required, and the cost increases by a tenfold per rank from there on in, all the way to &4SS&0.<br>The rank of the tool does not change its speed, but instead, it increases the power of its &4Active Ability&0.<br>Toggling the tool's ability can be done via right click.
botania.page.terraPick3=While the tool is active, it enables it to break blocks in an extended area. At rank &4C&0 it's a small column, which increases to a square at rank &4B&0, that gets larger trough the ranks. It's to note that the rank &4D&0 tool does not have the active ability.<br>Having the tool active consumes &4Mana&0 from its storage passively, even if not being used to mine.
botania.page.terraPick4=Lastly, the tool takes damage for every single block broken, so a good supply of &4Mana&0 in the wielder's inventory is a must for the higher ranks, as the tool does function like normal &1Manasteel Tools&0, in which it'll use &4Mana&0 instead of actually taking damage, given it's made of &1Terrasteel&0.<br>It also won't despawn like regular dropped items.
botania.page.terraPick5=Stronger than a Gastrea

# -- SOULSCRIBE
botania.entry.enderDagger=Soulscribe
botania.page.enderDagger0=Those &4Endermen&0. They're the second more pesky thing since &4Creepers&0. I swear, the person who came up with them must have taken a &onotch&r too much of their drink.<br>However, by infusing a standard dagger with some of their energy, one can create the &1Soulscribe&0, a dagger that tears through &1Endermen&0 as if they were butter.
botania.page.enderDagger1=Due of the type of infusion, though, the dagger only lasts for a few kills, and the energy that radiates from it prevents the &1Manasteel&0 from gathering &4Mana&0 to avoid damage, like typical tools would. Still, all in the name of killing those monsters.
botania.page.enderDagger2=Strike my Soul

# -- ROD OF THE SEAS
botania.entry.waterRod=Rod of the Seas
botania.page.waterRod0=Similarly to its land counterpart, the &1Rod of the Seas&0 will, at the cost of some &4Mana&0, place down a &1Water&0 block wherever it's used on. Furthermore, it can also be used to refill a &1Petal Apothecary&0.
botania.page.waterRod1=Keep the Earth clean, it isn't Uranus

# -- ELEMENTIUM EQUIPMENT
botania.entry.elfGear=Elementium Equipment
botania.page.elfGear0=Similarly to other metals, as expected, &1Elementium&0 can, too, be shaped into tools and armor.<br>These pieces of equipment have a decent resistance to damage, about half of that of diamond, as well as the ability to drain &4Mana&0 to prevent damage.
botania.page.elfGear1=Each of the tools come with their own ability or power of sorts which makes them unique. The armor allows the wearer to, when hit, have a chance to spawn a &1Pixie&0 that goes after the attacker, dealing decent damage.<br>The more pieces of &1Elementium Armor&0 equipped, the higher the chance.
botania.page.elfGear2=Starting off, the &1Elementium Pickaxe&0 will destroy any &1Cobblestone&0, &1Dirt&0, &1Netherrack&0 and other mundane materials, leaving behind only the ores and fine resources.<br>Combining the &1Elementium Pickaxe&0 with a &1Terra Shatterer&0 in a crafting square allows for the latter to also get this power. This can't be undone.
botania.page.elfGear3=I can fit a shower in my pocket, screw cobble
botania.page.elfGear4=The &1Elementium Shovel&0 will, case the block dug is affected by gravity (&1Gravel&0, &1Sand&0, etc), dig all the blocks of that material above and/or below it, no more gravel falling while mining.
botania.page.elfGear5=Putting Things on Top of Other Things
botania.page.elfGear6=The &1Elementium Axe&0 doubles as a weapon, if used to strike the finishing blow to a &4Zombie&0, &4Skeleton&0, &4Creeper&0 or even another &4Player&0, it has a chance to decapitate them, leaving their severed head or skull behind.  
botania.page.elfGear7=Off with their heads
botania.page.elfGear8=The &1Elementium Shears&0 hold the ability to, when held back like a bow, shear any nearby sheep with speed within a large area of effect centered on the holder.
botania.page.elfGear9=Nui? She's h-arm-less
botania.page.elfGear10=Lastly, the &1Elementium Sword&0 will increase the chance of a &4Pixie&0 spawning when hit (this holds true when no &1Elementium Armor&0 is worn) and increases the strength of any &4Pixies&0 spawned.
botania.page.elfGear11=The Lambent Light
botania.page.elfGear12=Fortuna on the Sixteenth Night
botania.page.elfGear13=When the Seagulls Cry Breakdown

# -- EXTRAPOLATED BUCKET
botania.entry.openBucket=Extrapolated Bucket
botania.page.openBucket0=By creating a bucket out of &1Elementium&0 one seems to notice an interesting feature. The liquids acquired by it simply vanish into the ether, never to be seen again. This seems like a great clean up tool.
botania.page.openBucket1=A Souvenir from Lewis

# -- LIFE AGGREGATOR
botania.entry.spawnerMover=Life Aggregator
botania.page.spawnerMover0=By arranging &1Dragonstone&0, &1Elementium&0 and &1Gaia Spirits&0 in a specific pattern, one can create a device that can contain the curious energies of a &1Monster Spawner&0 and materialize it in another point in space.<br>It's to note that the device will shatter after being used once.
botania.page.spawnerMover1=We got the spawner, but this isn't a won run yet

# -- ROD OF BIFROST
botania.entry.rainbowRod=Rod of Bifrost
botania.page.rainbowRod0=&4Bifrost&0, the rainbow bridge that reaches between the world and the realm of the gods.<br>While this item, the &1Rod of Bifrost&0 doesn't exactly do that, it allows the holder, via a right click and at the cost of some &4Mana&0, to create a rainbow bridge in the direction he or she is looking at.
botania.page.rainbowRod1=This bridge extends as far as a hundred blocks, and will vanish after about fifteen seconds.<br>Only one bridge can be created for any given &1Rod of Bifrost&0 at a time, as soon as the old bridge vanishes, a new one can be created.
botania.page.rainbowRod2=Going my way!! Cut open a path and go!

# -- ROD OF THE SKIES
botania.entry.tornadoRod=Rod of the Skies
botania.page.tornadoRod0=The &1Rod of the Skies&0 is a magical instrument with the ability to propel one in the air at fast velocity for the cost of some &4Mana&0.<br>To do so, one would simply hold it like a bow and watch as their momentum increases.<br>The rod takes a small amount of time to recharge, but during that time it'll block any fall damage, keeping the user safe.
botania.page.tornadoRod1=A treasure from Lorule

# -- ROD OF THE HELLS
botania.entry.fireRod=Rod of the Hells
botania.page.fireRod0=The &1Rod of the Hells&0 contains the essence of a burning flame, using it on the ground will create a circle of fire that burns anything inside it, for a decent cost of &4Mana&0.<br>The ring has a decent radius, and takes a small amount of time to fully propagate, it's to note that after that time it burns anything living in it, the caster included.
botania.page.fireRod1=Megu Megu Fire Endless Night

# -- VINE BALLS
botania.entry.vineBall=Vine Balls
botania.page.vineBall0=&1Ladders&0 can't stand up on their own, they require something on their back, whereas &1Vines&0 don't. Normally, though, &1Vines&0 aren't strong enough for someone to climb them when they're freestanding.<br>By combining a few &1Vines&0, it's possible to create a ball that can be thrown, to create a climbable ladder of strong &1Vines&0 where it hits.
botania.page.vineBall1=It's also possible, by combining some materials such as &1Livingwood&0 or a &1Rune of Air&0 to create a slingshot that lets these &1Vine Balls&0 be shot while completely ignoring the force of gravity.
botania.page.vineBall2=This would be in Vineacraft...
botania.page.vineBall3=...if that actually existed.

# -- SHARD OF LAPUTA
botania.entry.laputaShard=Shard of Laputa
botania.page.laputaShard0=Via a somewhat complex magic activation sequence, combining a few interesting resources, including &1Gaia Spirits&0 would allow one to create a shard that, when used on the ground, will allow one to lift a spherical area around that point up into the air.<br>This process consumes the shard and can take upwards of ten minutes depending on the mass of land.
botania.page.laputaShard2=The radius of the island creates start at 14 blocks, on other words, 28 blocks of diameter. It's possible to increase the size by upgrading the shard with additional &1Gaia Spirits&0, each one adds 1 block to the radius, or 2 to the diameter.
botania.page.laputaShard1=Look Shiro, Laputa exists!
botania.page.laputaShard3=Size does matter

# -- EQUESTRIAN VIRUS
botania.entry.virus=Equestrian Virus
botania.page.virus0=Through the mixing of some ingredients, a type of virus that can alter the genetic code of equestrian life can be made.<br>Using one of these viruses on a &1Horse&0 will alter its genetic code, turning it into either a &1Zombie&0 or &1Skeleton Horse&0. Not only will it do that, but it will vastly increase all the &1Horse&0's genetic attributes.
botania.page.virus1=No ponies here
botania.page.virus2=None here either

# -- ROD OF THE HIGHLANDS
botania.entry.skyDirtRod=Rod of the Highlands
botania.page.skyDirtRod0=While the &1Rod of the Lands&0 is all well and good, being able to place &1Dirt&0 without something to hold it would be great.<br>The &1Rod of the Highlands&0 does just that, while maintaining the original power of the &1Rod of the Lands&0, it can also place &1Dirt&0 in mid air, for an increased &4Mana&0 cost.
botania.page.skyDirtRod1=Dirty Stick mk2

# -- HAND OF ENDER
botania.entry.enderHand=Hand of Ender
botania.page.enderHand0=The &1Hand of Ender&0 allows the user to access the interdimensional ender field, on other words, their &1Ender Chest&0 inventory. This can be done anywhere by right clicking with the hand at the cost of some &4Mana&0.<br>Using the hand on another player will open up &otheir&r inventory instead, at a lot higher &4Mana&0 cost.
botania.page.enderHand0a=The &1Hand of Ender&0 allows the user to access the interdimensional ender field, on other words, their &1Ender Chest&0 inventory. This can be done anywhere by right clicking with the hand at the cost of some &4Mana&0.
botania.page.enderHand1=Zezima hates him!
botania.page.enderHand1a=It's like the 4G of Ender Chests

# -- VITREOUS PICKAXE
botania.entry.glassPick=Vitreous Pickaxe
botania.page.glassPick0=Placing down &1Glass&0 and having to break it again can be a heartbreaking experience. Luckily, by creating a &1Vitreous Pickaxe&0, one can gather the &1Glass&0 back by mining it with the pick, it's like cheap &4Silk Touch&0 for glass!
botania.page.glassPick1=Trapped inside with food

# -- ROD OF DIVINING
botania.entry.diviningRod=Rod of Divining
botania.page.diviningRod0=As its name implies, the &1Rod of Divining&0 has the ability to divine in a decently large radius around the user to find any ores. These will shine for a little bit, allowing their location.<br>This process, obviously, requires a decent amount of &4Mana&0 from the user's inventory.
botania.page.diviningRod1=inb4 ee3 

# -- ROD OF THE BLACK MESA
botania.entry.gravityRod=Rod of the Black Mesa
botania.page.gravityRod0=The &1Rod of the Black Mesa&0 is a powerful relic, legend says that the first of these devices was found atop a dark mesa, along with a crowbar.<br>To use this device, the user may right click and hold on a monster or item to pick it up. Releasing right click will drop the selected entity, while left click will fire it in a powerful burst.
botania.page.gravityRod1=This power does not come free, of course. It requires significant amounts of &4Mana&0 from the user's inventory.
botania.page.gravityRod2=Why the flax?

# -- TIMELESS IVY
botania.entry.regenIvy=Timeless Ivy
botania.page.regenIvy0=While &1Manasteel&0 or &1Elementium&0 tools have the ability to harness &4Mana&0 and use it to protect their bodies, other tools or armor don't have this property.<br>A handful of &1Timeless Ivy&0 can be attached on to virtually any item, allowing it to be repaired with &4Mana&0.
botania.page.regenIvy1=To apply it, one'd simply craft the tool in question alongside the ivy and 3 of an item that can be used to repair the tool in an anvil (eg. &1Diamonds&0 for a &1Diamond Pickaxe&0).<br>Due to not being in direct contact with the material, the amount of &4Mana&0 used by the ivy in comparison to &1Manasteel&0 is rather high.
botania.page.regenIvy2=Cut it in Varrock

# - BAUBLES
# -- AN INTRODUCTION TO BAUBLES
botania.entry.bIntro=An Introduction to Baubles
botania.page.bIntro0=&4Baubles&0, also commonly referred to as &4Trinkets&0 or &4Charms&0 are pieces of equipment which offer all sorts of different effects, when worn.<br>To equip them, one can press the &4B&0 (configurable) key. There's four slots, one &4Amulet&0 slot, two &4Ring&0 slots and one &4Belt&0 slot.
botania.page.bIntro1=The &4Baubles Screen&0
botania.page.bIntro2=It's to note that, if &4Thaumcraft&0 or any other mod that uses the baubles system is installed, this inventory will be shared between the various mods. 

# -- TINY PLANET
botania.entry.tinyPlanet=Tiny Planet
botania.page.tinyPlanet0=The &1Tiny Planet&0 is a &4Bauble&0 with gravitational proprieties, while equipped, the &1Tiny Planet&0 will pull any nearby &4Mana Bursts&0 towards the wearer, having them orbit around him or her.<br>By increasing its mass with some &1Stone&0, it can also be placed in world, for the same effect. 
botania.page.tinyPlanet1=Clearly from rebirth
botania.page.tinyPlanet2=More of a planet than Pluto

# -- BAND OF MANA
botania.entry.manaRing=Band of Mana
botania.page.manaRing0=Combining a &1Mana Tablet&0 with some &1Manasteel&0 creates an easily worn &4Ring&0, that functions exactly similar to the tablet used to make it, but can be worn as a &4Bauble&0.<br>Using some &1Terrasteel&0 allows for an upgrade, which lets it store about four times as much &4Mana&0.
botania.page.manaRing1=Creating the ring
botania.page.manaRing2=Upgrading the ring

# -- BAND OF AURA
botania.entry.auraRing=Band of Aura
botania.page.auraRing0=The &1Band of Aura&0 is a bit of a deviation from the typical &1Band of Mana&0, in which, instead of storing &4Mana&0, it slowly, while equipped, creates it and stores it into &4Mana&0 containing items in the wearer's inventory.<br>Using some &1Terrasteel&0 allows for an upgrade, which lets it generate &4Mana&0 at a significantly faster rate.

# -- SOUJOURNER'S SASH
botania.entry.travelBelt=Soujourner's Sash
botania.page.travelBelt0=Traversing terrain sometimes proves to be a hassle. The &1Soujourner's Sash&0 can be equipped in the &4Belt&0 slot, and when worn will increase the movement speed, jump height and resistance to fall damage of the wearer.<br>Lastly, if not sneaking, it also allows the wearer to walk over 1 block high gaps without jumping with ease.
botania.page.travelBelt1=...everell

# -- TECTONIC GIRDLE
botania.entry.knockbackBelt=Tectonic Girdle
botania.page.knockbackBelt0=By harnessing the forces of tectonic movement, the &1Tectonic Girdle&0, when worn, will negate any &4Knockback&0 applied to the wearer by outside attacks.

# -- SNOWFLAKE PENDANT
botania.entry.icePendant=Snowflake Pendant
botania.page.icePendant0=The &1Snowflake Pendant&0 is a &4Bauble&0 that resonates freezing energy, while it's worn, any nearby still &1Water&0 blocks at foot level will be converted into &1Ice&0.<br>The &1Ice&0 will melt shortly afterward the wearer leaves the area.

# -- GOLDEN LAUREL CROWN
botania.entry.goldenLaurel=Golden Laurel Crown

botania.page.waterRing1=Go swim with the fishes

# -- RING OF THE MANTLE
botania.entry.miningRing=Ring of the Mantle
botania.page.miningRing0=The &1Ring of the Mantle&0 allows one to mine faster, while equipped and &4Mana&0 is present in the inventory, it'll give a &4Haste&0 effect to the wearer.

botania.page.miningRing1=Diggy diggy hole

# -- RING OF MAGNETIZATION
botania.entry.magnetRing=Ring of Magnetization
botania.page.magnetRing0=By turning a &1Magnetizing Lens&0 into a wearable ring, one can use it to magnetize nearby items. While equipped, this ring will make any nearby items magnetize towards the wearer if they're not sneaking.<br>A notable feature of this piece is that it'll negate its effect for 5 seconds after the wearer tosses an item so as to not interfere with whatever means it was tossed for.
botania.page.magnetRing1=How do they work?

# -- RING OF FAR REACH
botania.entry.reachRing=Ring of Far Reach
botania.page.reachRing0=Through the power of one's Pride, nothing is out of their reach. By wearing the &1Ring of Far Reach&0, the maximum distance the wearer can break, place or interact with blocks, as well as attack or interact with entities is increased by about three blocks.

# -- FLUGEL TIARA
botania.entry.flightTiara=Flügel Tiara
botania.page.flightTiara0=The &4Flügel&0 were once a dominant species in the lands, now they're but a race past extinct, once created as godslayers, who possessed the ability of flight.<br>The usage of &1Gaia Spirits&0 allows for a small replica of their power, in the form of the &1Flügel Tiara&0, which, at the cost of &4Mana&0 allows for flight.
botania.page.flightTiara1=Forty thousand books from another world
botania.page.flightTiara2=Combining the Tiara with a variety of Quartz species allows for it to create various different kinds of aesthetic wings, one for each style of quartz.<br>The recipes for the various types of quartz can be found in the &4Decorative Blocks&0 entry under &4Misclaneous&0, &1Elven Quartz&0 is acquired by trading &1Nether Quartz&0 with the elves.

# -- GREAT FAIRY RING
botania.entry.pixieRing=Great Fairy Ring
botania.page.pixieRing0=This ring works alongside the &1Elementium Armor&0, insight in the powers of it is advised before using this ring.

# -- CRIMSON PENDANT
botania.entry.superLavaPendant=Crimson Pendant

# - ALFHOMANCY
# -- THE PORTAL TO ALFHEIM
botania.entry.aIntro=The Portal to Alfheim
botania.page.aIntro0=Once, in olden times, &4Elves&0 used to share the world with us &4Minecrafters&0. Due to unknown events, they have been banished back to their own world, &4Alfheim&0.<br>Experimentation has been done in atempt to bridge the gap between the two worlds, and means of creating a portal that does just that have been devised.
botania.page.aIntro1=Creating this portal proves not to be an easy task, as quite a few exquisite resources are necessary. The requirements are as follows: 8 &1Livingwood&0 blocks, 3 &1Glimmering Livingwood&0 blocks, 1 &1Elven Gateway Core&0 (read on), 2 &1Mana Pools&0 and 2 &1Natura Pylons&0 (read on).

botania.page.aIntro6=Place the &1Elven Gateway Core&0
botania.page.aIntro7=Add &1Mana Pools&0
botania.page.aIntro8=Place &1Natura Pylons&0 above the pools
botania.page.aIntro9=To open up the portal, simply right click the core with a &1Wand of the Forest&0.<br>The portal requires a substantial amount of &4Mana&0 deposited in both the pools to open up, after that, it'll slowly drain some to keep itself powered. If it runs out of &4Mana&0, the connection will be broken.
botania.page.aIntro10=The amount of &4Mana&0 required to open up the portal is orders of magnitude higher than that to keep it maintained, thus closing the portal to prevent &4Mana&0 loss is a poor strategy.<br>Furthermore, the link isn't strong enough to allow living beings to go through it, but it seems that &4items&0 can.
botania.page.aIntro11=The amount of information about &1Alfheim&0 stored in this lexicon is resumed to this entry alone, perhaps &4letting the Elves have a look at it&0 might prove beneficial.

botania.page.elfMessage0=
# ^ This is blank on purpose
botania.page.elfMessage1=&oGreetings. We noticed that our portal was opened via a link from another world. That's rather shocking news indeed. We thank you very much for providing us with a repository of the knowledge from your world, as to keep us up to date to what happened since we left it, it's been a while since then, indeed.
botania.page.elfMessage2=&oAfter some discussion with the high council of Elven Garde, we have decided to cooperate with you. You see, reading through your "Lexica Botania" has shown us a good amount of resources from your world that we would be extremely keen as to get our hands on, as these are non-existent in our lands.
botania.page.elfMessage3=&oThe link you have managed to establish is rather weak, no living beings will be able to go through, as you already know. However, there's a positive side to this, the link strikes the fabric of time of both our worlds in a way where it doesn't keep them in sync, that's the reason why you received your book back so quickly.
botania.page.elfMessage4=&oWhen it comes to Mana and other magical energies, we are plenty stocked on them, so worry not about the portal closing on our end. Let's put this in prospect, in order for the advance of both our civilizations, we vow to accept a given set of resources from your world we lack in ours in exchange for resources you lack in yours.
botania.page.elfMessage5=&oWe have taken the liberty of assigning our best scribes to put together a great set of knowledge from our world we're willing to share, you can find it in your lexicon just as you'd find knowledge from yours. We hope you find it enlightening and that it encourages you to invest in our materials.
botania.page.elfMessage6=&oLast but not least, do keep in mind that if you decide to send something we have not vouched to trade for, we will assume it as a gift and keep it for ourselves, just as a forewarning. We look forward to exchanging resources with you.<br>Best Regards, the High Council of Elven Garde.

# -- THE RESOURCES OF ALFHEIM
botania.entry.elfResources=The Resources of Alfheim
botania.page.elfResources0=&4Alfheim&0 contains a very varied amount of exquisite resources. Sadly though, most of them are extremely scarce and hard to come by due to competition between the various clans. The elves are interested in trading some materials, such as &1Dreamwood&0, &1Elementium&0, &1Pixie Dust&0 or &1Dragonstone&0, resources native to their lands. 
botania.page.elfResources1=Trading for &1Dreamwood&0
botania.page.elfResources2=&1Dreamwood&0, similarly to &1Livingwood&0 can be turned into various &4Decorative Blocks&0, have a look through the &4Decorative Blocks&0 entry under &4Miscelaneous&0 for the recipes.
botania.page.elfResources3=Trading for &1Elementium&0
botania.page.elfResources4=Trading for &1Pixie Dust&0
botania.page.elfResources5=Trading for &1Dragonstone&0
botania.page.elfResources6=The &1Elves&0 are also quite keen on the white posh block from the &4Nether&0, &1Nether Quartz&0, the ones they have on their world are tinted green. This quartz works just like any other quartz, be it normal &1Nether Quartz&0 or any of the decorative variants you can find on the &4Decorative Blocks&0 entry under &4Miscelaneous&0.
botania.page.elfResources7=Trading for &1Elven Quartz&0
botania.page.elfResources8=Alfheim also has its own variant of &1Glass&0, in the form of &1Alfglass&0. Its look is rather light and its patterns are randomized depending on where it's placed.
botania.page.elfResources9=Trading for &1Alfglass&0

# -- RITUAL OF GAIA
botania.entry.gaiaRitual=Ritual of Gaia
botania.page.gaiaRitual0=The &4Ritual of Gaia&0 is a procedure often enacted by the elves, which is the only way to acquire &1Gaia Spirits&0, which are essences of the power of the Goddess of Gaia herself.<br>This ritual required an &4Active&0 &1Beacon&0 with some &1Gaia Pylons&0 (read on) one level above the beacon as the altar, as well as a single &1Terrasteel Ingot&0 as a sacrifice.
botania.page.gaiaRitual1=Creating &1Gaia Pylons&0
botania.page.gaiaRitual2=Place the pylons (1 block above the beacon)
botania.page.gaiaRitual3=To start the ritual, simply shift-right click the &1Beacon&0 block with a &1Terrasteel Ingot&0, take a step back and prepare to fight for your life. Good preparation is required, as the fight with the &4Guardian of Gaia&0 can be even harder than that of the &4Wither&0. Upon defeating the &4Guardian&0, one can collect their prize, a handful of &1Spirits of Gaia&0.
botania.page.gaiaRitual4=A few pointers to take in mind are as follows. Enchanted &1Elementium Armor&0 is highly recommended, even more so than conventional &1Diamond Armor&0 due to the &1Pixies&0 it can spawn.<br>The effect on the &1Beacon&0 is nullified during the battle, that should be taken in mind when preparing.<br>Lastly, stay away from the purple.

# - MISCLANEOUS
# -- UNSTABLE CUBE
botania.entry.unstableBlocks=Unstable Cubes
botania.page.unstableBlocks0=Fiddling with highly powerful &4Mana&0 infused objects has lead to the creation of these strange cubes. They seem to emit some visual radiation in the form of colorful lightning, but it doesn't seem like it has any effects other than visual appeal.
botania.page.unstableBlocks1=They look fancy
botania.page.unstableBlocks2=And they come in all 16 colors
botania.page.unstableBlocks3=There's also a way of creating a different version of these that releases an extremely larger amount of energy, this time in the form of a beam towards the sky that extends into a cloud of sorts. This one also seems to be disableable via a &4Redstone Signal&0, it's called an &1Unstable Beacon&0, as it looks like one somehow.
botania.page.unstableBlocks4=Fireworks?
botania.page.unstableBlocks5=Combined entropy
botania.page.unstableBlocks6=It's also possible, by using the &1Unstable Beacons&0, to turn them into a manageable and portable utility, in the form of the &1Signal Flare&0.<br>This gun of sorts shoots a colored round into the sky that lasts a few seconds, it also stuns any nearby enemies for just as long.
botania.page.unstableBlocks7=Shoot in case of titan

# -- DECORATIVE BLOCKS
botania.entry.decorativeBlocks=Decorative Blocks
botania.page.decorativeBlocks0=Past functionality, quite a few decorative blocks are available to make your builds look better.<br>Starting off. It's possible to turn blocks of &1Livingrock&0 and &1Livingwood&0 into decorative blocks. Each of them features 4 different decorative variations.
botania.page.decorativeBlocks1=Livingrock bricks.
botania.page.decorativeBlocks2=Mossing the bricks

botania.page.decorativeBlocks8=Pattern planks
botania.page.decorativeBlocks9=Glimmering livingwood
botania.page.decorativeBlocks10=Carrying on, by combining &1Nether Quartz&0 with all sorts of other substances, it's possible to create a wide array of other decorative &1Quartz&0 blocks.<br>As expected, all these items can be crafted into all their decorative block counterparts just like regular &1Quartz&0 blocks are crafted. 
botania.page.decorativeBlocks11=Smokey Quartz
botania.page.decorativeBlocks12=Mana Quartz
botania.page.decorativeBlocks13=Blaze Quartz
botania.page.decorativeBlocks14=Lavender Quartz
botania.page.decorativeBlocks15=Redquartz
botania.page.decorativeBlocks16=A few blocks can be organized in methods different than normal to create new building blocks, such as &1Reed Blocks&0, &1Thatch&0, &1Roof Tiles&0 and a few new &1Bricks&0.<br>All these also can be crafted into both stairs and slabs.
botania.page.decorativeBlocks17=Crafting &1Reed Blocks&0
botania.page.decorativeBlocks18=Crafting &1Thatch&0
botania.page.decorativeBlocks19=Crafting &1Roof Tiles&0
botania.page.decorativeBlocks20=Crafting &1Hellish Bricks&0

# -- DISPENSER TWEAKS
botania.entry.dispenserTweaks=Dispenser Tweaks
botania.page.dispenserTweaks0=&1Dispensers&0, among their normal abilities, can also plant all sorts of crops, from &1Seeds&0, &1Potatos&0 or &1Carrots&0 to even &1Nether Wart&0. The crop is planted in the block right in front of the dispenser.<br>The &1Dispensers&0 can also use the &1Wand of the Forest&0 for some specific tasks such as triggering a &1Runic Altar&0.

# -- GLIMMERING FLOWERS
botania.entry.shinyFlowers=Glimmering Flowers
botania.page.shinyFlowers0=By combining your typical &1Mystical Flowers&0 with some &1Glowstone Dust&0, you can make them sparkle even brighter, and emit actual physical light, of the same brightness as a &1Glowstone Block&0.<br>With some &1Dirt&0 and &1Pasture Seeds&0 it's possible to turn them into a miniature floating island that will not only emit light, but also look very fancy indeed.
botania.page.shinyFlowers1=Pretty Pretty Shiny Shiny
botania.page.shinyFlowers2=Like Laputa but (a lot) tinier

# -- PRISMARINE
botania.entry.prismarine=Prismarine
botania.page.prismarine0=&1Prismarine&0 is an interesting component and building block. Some scholars even go as far as to say it comes from &4the future&0.<br>To create it, one requires an &1Alchemy Catalyst&0. Simply tossing some &1Nether Quartz&0 into a &1Mana Pool&0 with the catalyst attached to it will get some of this material.
botania.page.prismarine1=There's various building blocks that can be created using the &1Prismarine Shards&0, to which all but the &1Sea Lantern&0 can be turned into their &1Stair&0 and &1Slab&0 variants.
botania.page.prismarine2=Creating &1Prismarine Shards&0
botania.page.prismarine3=Crafting &1Prismarine&0

# -- NATURAL SHEDDING
botania.entry.shedding=Natural Shedding
botania.page.shedding0=The living and unliving beings that inhabit our lands don't live in a static state. It's common for pieces of their body to fall out, or for them to drop things, or for them to extrude substances. The following pages list some such items that can come from such entities.

# -- TINY POTATO
botania.entry.tinyPotato=Tiny Potato
botania.page.tinyPotato0=It's a tiny potato, it believes in you, you can do the thing.<br>No really, that's it, by tossing a &1Potato&0 in a &1Mana Pool&0, the potato gains a little lively essence and happy feeling. It's a lively one, giving it a right click will make it even more so!
botania.page.tinyPotato1=Put it on Kickstarter, it'll work 

# -- HEAD CREATION
botania.entry.headCreating=Head Creation
botania.page.headCreating0=A typical incantation of the Elves, combining a few resources and a &1Name Tag&0 allows for the creation of a replica of sorts of the head of the person described in the tag. How it works isn't really known, but it seems to be possible to replicate it with a &1Runic Altar&0.
botania.page.headCreating1=Get your head in the game

# -- AZULEJO -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azulejo
botania.entry.azulejo=Azulejos
botania.page.azulejo0=&1Azulejos&0 are a type of decorative block, simply put, they are tileable patterns of blue and white. To create them, one would simply mix a piece of &1Lapis Lazulli&0 with a &1Block of Quartz&0.<br>From there, placing it in the crafting grid allows for cycling between the twelve different patterns.
botania.page.azulejo1=The various patterns
botania.page.azulejo2=Crafting a block of &1Azulejo&0
botania.page.azulejo3=Cycling between the patterns

# -- STARFIELD CREATOR
botania.entry.starfield=Starfield Creator
botania.page.starfield0=The &1Starfield Creator&0 does exactly as it says, by releasing elven energies into the air, if it's placed in the world, during night time it will create a starry sky that extends for a fair distance.
botania.page.starfield1=Twinkle twinkle

# -- THAUMCRAFT INTEGRATION
botania.entry.tcIntegration=Thaumcraft Integration
botania.page.tcIntegration0=Often enough, the paths of &4Botany&0 and &4Thaumaturgy&0 cross together. Mixing some of the artifacts mentioned in this book as well as any from the school of &5Thaumcraft&0 can allow for combinations of these to form.
botania.page.tcIntegration1=First and foremost, combining any of the &1Mana Metal&0 helms with a set of &1Goggles of Revealing&0 allows for a combination of both.<br>The protection and regenerability of the armor works alongside the Goggles' abilities, but the &4Vis&0 discount is loss. 
botania.page.tcIntegration2=Helmets of Revealing (works with any Botania helm)
botania.page.tcIntegration3=Carrying on, &4Mana&0 can also serve as an interesting type of Ink. Infusing a set of black &1Scribing Tools&0 with &4Mana&0 from a &1Mana Pool&0 allows for them to use said &4Mana&0 as their source of color.<br>Refilling these tools works similarly to a &1Mana Tablet&0, done by tossing it on top of the pool.
botania.page.tcIntegration4=Making the &1Botanurgist's Inkwell
botania.page.tcIntegration5=Last but not least, there's a few varied resources or constructs that can work as paraphernalia for an &1Infusion Altar&0, to lower its' instability.<br>These come in the form of &1Glimmering Flowers, Floating Flowers and any variety of Pylons&0.
