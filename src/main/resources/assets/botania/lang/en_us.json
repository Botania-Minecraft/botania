Whichever applies.<br>\u00a7oYou can navigate this book using the arrows at the bottom of this page, your mouse wheel or the arrow keys in your keyboard.",
  "botania.page.welcome1": "\u00a7oDespite its looks, Botania is in essence a \"tech mod\", by definition of requiring you to put to use ingenuity, thought and redstone to create and progress. It's good to keep that in mind.<br>\u00a7oOf course you'll also be rewarded with cool toys, blocks and equipment, if you're worried.",
  "botania.page.welcome2": "\u00a7oFor all intents and purposes, Botania is a mod for anybody who likes to play the game with the primary purpose of building cool things. It is designed to be fully playable standalone, but is also playable with other mods.<br>\u00a7oExcluding a couple cases, everything in the mod is fully automatable using only Minecraft and itself.",
  "botania.page.welcome3": "\u00a7oIf you happen to find yourself lost, try checking out the mod's Advancements or Challenges, both of which can be found on the left hand side of this book's main page.<br>\u00a7oThe book is laid out in a friendly way with a good amount of handy features, so before you start jumping in and playing, take a bit of time to familiarize yourself with what the various tidbits around the place do.",
  "botania.page.welcome4": "\u00a7oAfter this you'll be taken to a page where you can optionally start a tutorial that will teach you the basics of the mod in around ten minutes, give or take.<br>\u00a7oHowever, it teaches you only the very basics. So, after you have a good foothold on those concepts, further research is a good idea.",
  "botania.page.welcome5": "\u00a7oIf you're unsure as to what you want to learn about, hold SHIFT while browsing through the various categories to get a quick idea of what each thing is.<br>\u00a7oThe \"Lexicon Index\" category can be very helpful for searching, as it contains every entry in the book in one place.",
  "botania.page.welcome6": "\u00a7oAnd that's it for this introduction! You can move on to the tutorial now. I hope you enjoy playing with Botania as much as I enjoyed making it!<br>\u00a7o~Vazkii, the mod author<br><br>\u00a7oCarry on by pressing the \"Back\" button on the bottom.
