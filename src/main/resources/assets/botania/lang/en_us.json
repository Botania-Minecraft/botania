Whichever applies.$(p)$(o)You can navigate this book using the arrows at the bottom of this page, your mouse wheel, or the arrow keys in your keyboard.",
  "botania.page.welcome1": "$(o)Despite its appearance, Botania is in essence a \"tech mod\", by definition: it requires you to put to use ingenuity, thought and redstone to create and progress. It would be good to keep that in mind.$(p)$(o)Of course you'll also be rewarded with cool toys, blocks and equipment, just in case you were worried about that.",
  "botania.page.welcome2": "$(o)Botania is a mod for anybody who likes to play this game for the purpose of building cool things. It is designed to be fully playable standalone, but is also playable with other mods.$(p)$(o)Outside a few special cases, everything in the mod is fully automatable with only Minecraft and itself.",
  "botania.page.welcome3": "$(o)If you happen to find yourself feeling lost, try checking out the mod's Advancements or Challenges, both of which can be found on the left hand side of this book's main page.$(p)$(o)The book is laid out in a friendly way, with a fair number of helpful features, so before you jump in and start playing, take a bit of time to familiarize yourself with the uses of those.",
  "botania.page.welcome4": "$(o)After this intro, you can start a tutorial that will teach you the basics of the mod in around ten minutes, give or take.$(p)$(o)However, it'll only teach you the very basics. So, after you have a good hold on those concepts, further research would be a good idea.",
  "botania.page.welcome5": "$(o)If you're unsure as to what you want to learn about, hold SHIFT while browsing through the various categories to get a quick idea of what each entry's about.$(p)$(o)The \"Lexicon Index\" category is helpful for searching for a particular entry, as it contains every entry in the book in one place.",
  "botania.page.welcome6": "$(o)And that's it for this introduction! You can move on to the tutorial now. I hope you enjoy playing with Botania as much as I enjoyed making it!$(p)$(o)~Vazkii, the mod author$(p)$(p)$(o)Continue by pressing the \"Back\" button on the bottom.
