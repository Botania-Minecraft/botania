Notes for the Botania on Multiloader experience report talk, given at BlanketCon 2022

Eventually this should all make its way into the presentation one way or another

* History and Motivations
 Botania was a Forge mod for most of its life (late 1.6 to 1.16)
 Fabric work was first floated around 1.16, and a 1.16 branch was started
 Botania-fabric 1.16 was actually playable enough to have a private skyblock test world, but was never publicly released
 In 1.17, Fabric actually became the primary branch as Forge broke Mixins and was taking forever to fix them
 Forge never received a 1.17 version as a result
 In 1.18, we moved to a multiloader setup which unified both loaders' codebases into one repository/branch, leaving us where we are today
* The process of porting to Fabric
** Port Patchouli
   see willie's old blog post experience report
   fairly painless, most of Patchouli is loader-agnostic already (modulo mappings)
** Remap to Yarn
   Used ramidzkh's yarnforge-plugin
   A gradle plugin you apply to a Forge project, which spits out yarn-remapped source
** Easy substitutions
   @SideOnly -> @Environment
** Remove Forge API usages
   Fabric API where available, Mixin otherwise
* The process of moving to multiloader
** A brief explanation of multiloader
   - Xplat module: Can only interface with vanilla
   - Forge/Fabric module: Can interact with loader-specific code, Xplat code "pasted" into it
   - Mojmap is a must
** Port Patchouli (again)
   Notice a pattern? Patchouli is our testbed
