# Botania Flower Character Profiles (fka Flowersonas)
This section includes character profiles for each Miscellaneous, Generating, and
Functional Flower in Botania. It's inspired by the character profiles included with the
games of the [Touhou Project](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Project).

These profiles were authored by williewillus and Alwinfy.

## Pure Daisy
* Gender: Gender is irrelevant for flowers (they/them)
* Physical symbols: white, angel
* Likes: Things being orderly, precision, perfectionism
* Dislikes: Unexpected changes of plan, others not putting forth their full effort

Pure Daisy is the flower your parents always compared you to. They were the
perfect-attendance flower, the spelling-bee champion flower, the all-A's flower.

Doted on by everyone, Pure Daisy embraces both the expectations and the praise heaped onto
themself and works hard. They work as an executive at a highly prestigious finance
company, and in their free time enjoy playing skill games that require absolute perfection
in execution, such as *Touhou* or *osu!*.

As a result of their perfectionism, Pure Daisy can easily get upset when things don't go
according to plan.

## Manastar
* Gender: Trans female (she/her)
* Physical symbols: 0 and 1; blue and red
* Likes: Data, programming socks, Clojure and Julia programming languages
* Dislikes: R, MATLAB, people who think correlation means causation

From a young age, Manastar has loved making observations about the world around her. She
would keep a detailed notebook full of tables and plots of happenings she had observed
around her, from the number of children on the bus to school that day, to how many steps
it took to get from History class to the Band Hall, to the average number of tater tots
the lunch lady would give to her over the course of the semester.

It was to no one's surprise then, that she became enamored in data science, probability,
and statistics, going to a prestigious school for a Data Science degree and later becoming
an analyst for Mana Corp.

Manastar has endless passion for data science, so outside of work, she continues
contributing to open data science frameworks, and collecting and analyzing data from her
daily life. Now it was things like the number of students studying data science, the
number of steps in her daily commute to work, and the average length of time kisses with
her girlfriend last.

(Her girlfriend doesn't mind, and finds Manastar's nerdiness absolutely adorable.)

## Daybloom
* Gender: Male (he/him)
* Physical symbols: Setting Sun
* Likes: Fame, the grind, leadership, Nightshade, renewable energy
* Dislikes: Hydroangea

Daybloom was one of the hottest names in Minecraft, adored by his fanboys and fangirls,
and usually touring for ten months in a year with the band he formed with his cousin
Nightshade and high school friend Hydroangea.

A musical genius, Daybloom was the guitarist and lead vocalist, and the brains of the
entire operation. A tireless worker, Daybloom toiled day and night to get the band off of
the ground and into the limelight, juggling management duties with performance and
composition (because he didn't trust anyone else to do as good a job).

One fated day, deep into a tour in which every show was a sellout, Hydroangea approached
him and mentioned that they wanted to cut the tour short and return home due to excessive
stress. Daybloom was shocked, then panicked. Did Hydroangea not understand the commitments
that they had made, both to their fans and to their contract partners? This move would
cost them dearly and destroy all the plans he had laid out for the group in the next
two years.

Daybloom considered Hydroangea a good friend, but in the heat of the moment, he lost his
composure. The heated discussion ended with Hydroangea leaving for the next flight home.
Daybloom and Nightshade, in a struggle, managed to finish the tour with a backup drummer
and return home. Daybloom immediately began another round of planning; there was no time
to lose salvaging the group's plans. He attempted to recruit a new full-time drummer, but
after a few gigs that were panned as the worst of the band's history, it quickly became
clear that what the fans truly appreciated were the dynamic trio of brave and outspoken
Daybloom, demure and cute Nightshade, and stoic and thoughtful Hydroangea. Their best days
were now behind them.

With resignation, Daybloom announced his retirement. The group had made more than enough
in their several-year run for him to live the rest of his life comfortably, but Daybloom
ruminates on returning the industry quite often.

His feelings about Hydroangea remain complicated. On one hand, Hydroangea's departure was
the *de facto* reason the band broke up. On the other hand, he had come to understand and
somewhat empathize with Hydroangea's reasoning. Despite usually being the confident and
fearless leader during their performing years, he has not contacted Hydroangea since that
night. However, their phone number remains in his contacts list, and perhaps one day
Daybloom can muster up the confidence to tap the "Call" button.

## Nightshade
* Gender: Female (she/her)
* Physical symbols: New Moon
* Likes: Astrology, Daybloom, renewable energy
* Dislikes: Making decisions

The younger cousin of Daybloom, Nightshade served as bassist and occasional vocalist of
the group formed by the duo and their high school friend Hydroangea. She's known for her
cute yet reserved personality.

Nightshade often has decision paralysis and finds it hard to make major choices and
decisions. As a result, she often left much of the band's creative work to Daybloom
and Hydroangea.

This came to a head one night during a tour. Hydroangeas had come and requested a leave of
absence from the rest of the tour, which sent Daybloom into a panic. The conversation
escalated into an impassioned argument, in which Nightshade heard several sentences she
was sure both of them would regret saying sooner or later. But at the time, she felt
powerless to step between them. When all was said and done, Hydroangea had left the hotel,
and Daybloom was tearfully scrambling to figure out the logistics of such a drastic
change.

What if I had spoken up then?

Could I have kept the band together?

Those questions remains with Nightshade to this day. After Daybloom announced his
retirement, Nightshade quickly followed suit. With her earnings, she opened a small shop
where she gives psychic readings, astrological predictions, tarot card readings,
*fengshui* calculations, among other similar arts. She has rarely touched her bass since.

## Hydroangea
* Name: Hydroangea
* Gender: Fish (they/them)
* Physical symbols: Ripples
* Likes: Drumming, water, peace and quiet, meditation, self-reflection
* Dislikes: Large crowds, stress

Hydroangea was a drummer in high school, but never cared for making it big. In a massive
stroke of luck, they somehow befriended Daybloom, who quickly recognized Hydroangeas'
talent for the drumset and recruited them into his band. At first, the group played
small-time gigs in bars and clubs, but quickly made a name for themselves. From
hole-in-the-wall establishments, they went to auditoriums, to stadiums, to worldwide tours
within a year. Hydroangea happily went along with it, appreciating the new experiences
that came with each song, album, and tour.
  
The stresses of being world-famous quickly got to Hydroangea, however. Long hours
rehearsing, composing, recording, and touring quickly wore down on Hydroangea,
eventually leading to several panic attacks and visits to the psychiatrist.
  
One day, halfway through another grueling tour and after several long nights of thought,
Hydroangea made up their mind. They met with Daybloom and Nightshade in their hotel
room, and with sincerest apologies told the duo that Hydrangea would not be able to
continue with the group after the tour was over. Daybloom did not take it well:
  
* "What about the fans?"
* "Our contract extends for another two years!"
* "Everyone is counting on you"!
* "Please, just until our contract expires?"
* "You're not pulling your weight here!"
  
were among the phrases Hydroangea heard in the room that day. Hydroangeas was torn once
more between staying and going, but came to the realization that prioritizing their own
health and well-being was more important than the next paycheck or the next moment under
the spotlight.  Disappointed and saddened by their friends' lack of empathy, Hydroangea
gathered their belongings, thanked and apologized to each and every member of the crew,
and departed for home that night, knowing they would likely never see either Daybloom or
Nightshade in person again.

Today, Hydrangea lives a well-off life from the money made from the band's peak years, and
continues to drum under a pseudonym, though they explicitly keep it amateur and refuse all
offers to form a commercial group.

When not drumming, they can often be found soaking in a pool or splashing around in the
rain (miraculously, they've not managed to catch a cold from it yet). While water is their
favorite element, they tend to feel out of place at social gatherings -- right now, an
hour is about their limit for parties and such, after which they steal off for some alone
time.

## Daybloom Motif and Nightshade Motif
* Gender: Varies

Since the band's breakup, many fans have missed the trio. This led to many impersonators
popping up, which the fanbase have nicknamed "Motifs". These impersonators are often able
to impressively imitate Daybloom and Nightshade's appearance and behavior, but are never
able to replicate their musical prowess. Notably absent are Hydroangea impersonators, as
Hydroangea put out a statement requesting fans to not impersonate them, and to instead
show their love by purchasing the band's old records and merch.

## Endoflame
* Gender: Too young to have one
* Physical symbols: Sichuan peppercorn, spicy Cheetos
* Likes: Spicy food, naps, meadows
* Dislikes: Anything that disrupts the above

Endoflame is a teenager who has gained a modest following online for their ability to
stoically eat literally anything and everything spicy, up to and including actual flaming
chunks of coal. They discovered this genius talent during an *incident* in which an entire
bottle of Sichuan peppercorn and chili pepper fell into their soup and they finished the
soup without so much as a hiccup.

Their friends at school are extremely jealous of Endoflame's ability, and Endoflame loves
to demonstrate for others in turn.

Beyond that, however, they're a bit lazy, and they don't really have many aspirations
beyond getting to eat the next spicy thing.

## Thermalily
* Gender: Female (she/her)
* Physical symbols: Fire
* Likes: Streaming, parties, (ostensibly) spicy foods
* Dislikes: Trolls, their followers that send them weird messages

Many find Thermalily, a small-time CorporeaNet entertainer, to be hot as hell at first --
before they meet the streamer's fiery temper. While she meant to be a variety YouSparker
at first, she was soon inspired by classmate Endoflame's adventures in spice to take on
the challenges of sampling various hot-sauces for herself.

However, despite all her attempts, her spice tolerance has stayed atrocious, and after
every sampling she invariably needs a break (often up to five minutes in length), usually
accompanied by loud cursing and fuming.

## Rosa Arcana
* Gender: Male (he/him)
* Physical symbols: 
* Likes: 
* Dislikes: Bad DM's

Idea: TTRPG nerd
Yes, his name has "Rosa" in it. No, he doesn't care.
	
## Munchdew
* Gender:
* Physical symbols: Head of lettuce
* Likes: Tofu, soybeans
* Dislikes: PETA, meat, snake-oil health products

Idea: Hardcore vegan, but also co-invented Munchdew-y decimal system alongside Labellia lol

## Entropinnyum
* Gender: We asked them and they proudly handed us a card which was too singed to read
* Physical symbols: Fireworks, red, black, silver
* Likes: Skydiving, scuba diving, hang-gliding, spelunking, urban exploration, pyrotechnics
* Dislikes: Doing any of the above illegally

Entropinnyum lives their life on the edge. They love exploring the risky, the unknown, and
doing the things that others are too afraid of doing-- so much, in fact, that they've made
a career out of it: they provide coaching for the various activities that they enjoy,
helping others get a taste of their own exciting life.

While this has given them a reputation of being overly reckless, in reality Entropinnyum
knows their limits exactly, and never takes anything too far (often stopping right before
the line). In fact, Entropinnyum despises those that actually *do* take things too far, in
particular harboring a special hatred for illegally-traded explosives.

## Kekimurus
* Gender: 
* Physical symbols: cake, pie
* Likes:
* Dislikes: Having to eat savory food to survive

Idea: Sweets connoisseur that somehow is immune to diabetes

## Gourmaryllis
* Gender:
* Physical symbols:
* Likes:
* Dislikes:

Idea: Nutritionist

## Narslimmus
* Gender: Male (he/him)
* Physical symbols: Glue, pipes
* Likes: Trampolines, mushrooms, Go Karts, cute girls
* Dislikes: Scaly reptiles, particularly turtles

Narslimmus is your friendly neighborhood plumber. He offers services at a fraction of the
price of the neighboring Home Storehouse and Wowe's home improvement stores, does a
quality job, even going so far as to refuse any payment until the job was done.

"I'm confident that you'll be willing to pay for my services!"

Is what he would tell bewildered clients when explaining why he took no deposits.

When not working, he enjoys jumping on trampolines, foraging for mushrooms, and working on
his Go Kart, which he drives everywhere in lieu of a standard vehicle.

In perhaps what is a surprising twist given his field of employment, Narslimmus has quite
a soft heart and loves browsing for adorable and wholesome content on the internet. He's
still quite young, single, and thus often dreams of meeting a cute girl to pamper and
treat respectfully as his girlfriend.

## Spectrolus
* Gender: Fluid; varies based on day, mood, phase of the moon, most recent syzygy, and/or
  last meal eaten
* Physical symbols: Rainbow
* Likes: Skittles, tapestry, weaving, sewing, mutton
* Dislikes: Greyscale, bland colors, plastic

Spectrolus loves every color of the rainbow, and loves every kind of love. They're an
active member of various social justice initiatives, being a vocal proponent of activism
in all its forms.

Career-wise, Spectrolus is a connoisseur of fine ethically-spun wools, silks, and fabrics,
using them to weave elaborate tapestries and articles of clothing.

Although Spectrolus usually tries to eat a varied vegetarian diet, mutton is a guilty
pleasure of theirs, and Spectrolus will scarf it down whenever given the opportunity.

## Rafflowsia
* Gender: None
* Physical symbols: Lantern, Scythe
* Likes: The little things in life
* Dislikes: None

The elegance of all things. The impermanence of all things. The fleeting briefness of
life. These were ideas that Rafflowsia had begun to grasp since they started working at a
funeral home as a funeral director.

Day after day, families of deceased flowers would come into the funeral home to pay their
last respects and send their loved ones to the everafter, and Rafflowsia would watch them
quietly, taking in each unique situation and pondering it.

Rafflowsia had seen services where the so-called "family" was already at each other's
throats over the inheritance. Services where someone all-to-young was taken from the
world, services where a despised villain finally met their end. Services where nary a
person was present besides the deceased's spouse. Services where the hall was packed with
family, friends, and students returning from afar to pay their respects to someone who had
changed their lives.

Life was short, impermanent, and cruel, yet also elegant, beautiful, and passionate.
Twinged with melancholy and sadness, yet full of things worth living for.

Rafflowsia strove to embody this wistful yet optimistic mindset, in order to make their
life one well-worth living.

## Dandelifeon
* Gender: We asked and they enthusiastically gave us a lecture (with diagrams) on the
  homomorphism of gender identity to a generalizable infinitely-differentiable fractal
  manifold completely characterized by several characteristic points, then handed us a
  list of coordinates and sprinted down the hallway with a cheerful "Figure it out!"
* Physical symbols: Lambda sign
* Likes: Clojure, Haskell, Emacs
* Dislikes: Python, C/C++, software engineers who think theory is useless

Dandelifeon is the eccentric young mathematics professor at the local university who
specializes in the maths adjacent to theories of computation. In practice, this means
that students often get somewhat lost at their lectures.

Having worked through SICP at the age of 5 and graduated with a Ph. D at the age of 18,
they rarely go out to socialize, preferring to instead bury themself in their
studies.

They spend their vanishingly little spare time ricing their Emacs installation, debating
people online (often getting into pointless debates about programming languages with
Heisei Dream), and watching nerdy TV shows.

## Shulk Me Not
* Gender: Female (she/her)
* Physical symbols: Crown
* Likes: Esports, Touhou, osu!
* Dislikes: Games that don't require thinking or skill

Shulk-Me-Not is a professional esports player currently at the peak of her career. Though
the game she's competed in has changed over time, what has always been a constant is her
hypercompetitive nature, absolute confidence, and undeniable skill.

She loves basking in the glory and fame that comes with being a skilled player, and it is
common to see her on promotional videos with the league, to the point where she is even
sometimes seen as the figurehead of esports. This is what peak performance looks like.

Because of this, teams scramble to one-up each other with larger and larger payments, in
order to nab her as their ace and team leader. This sometimes doesn't work out well,
though, as Shulk-Me-Not's direct and often abrasive personality can be difficult to mesh
with in a team setting. One of the most respected members of the team was once left in
tears after he was berated by Shulk-Me-Not for missing a critical attack.

Precisely due to this focus on skill and high-achievement, Shulk-Me-Not is best friends
with Pure Daisy, and when not busy with work the two can often be found testing their
danmaku skills against each other in *Touhou 9: Phantasmagoria of Flower View*.

## Jaded Amaranthus
* Gender:
* Physical symbols:
* Likes:
* Dislikes: 

## Bellethorne
* Gender:
* Physical symbols:
* Likes:
* Dislikes: 

Idea: somewhat of an asshole

## Dreadthorne
* Gender:
* Physical symbols:
* Likes:
* Dislikes: 

Idea: somewhat of an asshole

## Heisei Dream
* Gender: Hot topic of debate on many forums they frequent; they give a different response
  to each inquiry
* Physical symbols: :trolled: emote
* Likes: KenM, Rick Astley (they're an actual fan of his music), The Onion
* Dislikes: Fake "trolling" (most of their friend-group's been subjected to the "shouting
  slurs doesn't count" rant at least thrice)

Heisei Dream is a master of the old school internet trolling, in what they believe is its
original, purest, most tasteful meaning. They love making jokes that poke fun at various
celebrities, topics in the news, and indeed themself.

They do enjoy, on extremely rare occasion, baiting for flamewars on inconsequential topics
(such as "iOS vs Android" and "should the toilet paper roll go inside or outside").

When not trolling, Heisei Dream takes their studies in internet sociology surprisingly
seriously.

## Tigerseye
* Gender: Cat person
* Physical symbols: Pusheen
* Likes: Cats, Miles Edgeworth from *Ace Attorney*
* Dislikes: Leafy greens

Nobody knows how Tigerseye manages to keep cats, since they are a flower, but they
do. They have 11 very-spoiled cats that live luxurious lives filled with food and belly
rubs.

Tigerseye has sworn off dating and marriage for the rest of their life, saying that their
fur babies will last them until the day they finally wilt and die.

Career-wise, Tigerseye serves as a skilled prosecutor and specializes in prosecuting
sexual abuse offenders.

## Orechid
* Gender:
* Physical symbols:
* Likes:
* Dislikes: 

Idea: miner

## Orechid Ignem
* Gender:
* Physical symbols:
* Likes:
* Dislikes: 

Idea: Orechid's senior

## Fallen Kanade
* Gender: Canadian
* Physical symbols: Maple syrup (only the best)
* Likes: Their mates
* Dislikes: People from the USA acting superior to Canadians

Fallen Kanade is a stereotypical Canadian through and through. They are immune to the cold
(and have been wearing shorts in temperatures well below -20C), have an endless obsession
with maple syrup, and visit Tim Hartin's daily.

Fallen Kanade's friends from other countries tease them about this incessantly, though
Fallen Kanade doesn't mind too much. In their opinion, such stereotypes were ones they
were proud to fit into. They were proud of their bodily strength, their country's
dedication to quality maple syrup, and their country's own homegrown chain of stores.

One stereotype Fallen Kanade doesn't fit into, however, is excessive politeness. From a
young age, Fallen Kanade learned the hard way that being excessively deferential and
conflict-avoiding was a quick path to being taken advantage of. Instead, Fallen Kanade is
polite and friendly, but knows when to assert themself when things come down to the wire.

Overall a very pleasant mate to hang out with.

## Exoflame
* Gender: Tastefully done eyeliner that renders their features extra androgynous
* Physical symbols: a party hat, but specifically the one from OSRS
* Likes: Meeting new people, helping friends in need, Endoflame
* Dislikes: When hangout plans fall through

Despite their floral nature, Exoflame is by far the social butterfly of the group. Despite
planning all the fun parties, hangouts, and trips, they alway make concerted efforts to
spend quality time with their friends and family (much to the chagrin of Endoflame, their
introverted younger sibling).

Nor is their energy is limited to group settings-- Exoflame listens attentively whenever
friends turn to them for help, often offering positive support and thoughtful advice
that's exactly what the friend needs to hear. As a result, Exoflame is deeply trusted by
nearly everybody they know.

## Agricarnation
* Gender:
* Physical symbols:
* Likes:
* Dislikes: 

Idea: farmer

## Hopperhock
* Gender:
* Physical symbols:
* Likes:
* Dislikes: 

## Tangleberrie
* Gender:
* Physical symbols:
* Likes:
* Dislikes: 

## Jiyuulia
* Gender:
* Physical symbols:
* Likes:
* Dislikes:

## Labellia
* Gender:
* Physical symbols:
* Likes:
* Dislikes: 

Idea: Librarian

## Rannuncarpus
* Gender: Removed -- it was only holding them back
* Physical symbols: Toy slap hands
* Likes: Piano, building castles and other large structures in Minecraft
* Dislikes: Getting cold hands before work

Rannuncarpus is extremely skilled with their hands and loves anything requiring fine
manual skill. Though a professional pianist by trade, Rannuncarpus also performs
electronics repair on the side for supplemental income.

Interestingly enough, though highly skilled while on the job, Rannuncarpus can be
surprisingly clumsy and prone to accident in their private life. Even so, they have an
easygoing attitude and are always happy to hook up their friends and family with free
concerts (or repairs).

## Hyacidus
* Gender: Nonbinary (they/them)
* Physical symbols: Pill
* Likes: Medicine and drugs(?), Relaxing
* Dislikes: Work, Doctors with indecipherable handwriting

Hyacidus is the stereotypical textbook example of "C's get degrees". Throughout life,
they've always coasted through, relying either on their innate intelligence or privileged
background to carry them through tough situations. And it's worked most of the time!

Hyacidus barely graduated pharmacy school with C's, and now works at your neighbor hood
pharmacy, dutifully filling the prescriptions of patients that come to them. They are
neither negligent nor particularly exemplary in their job, instead having completely
mastered the art of "caring just enough to get by".

An easygoing, stressless, and free life. Hyacidus wouldn't trade it for anything else in
the world.

## Pollidisiac
* Gender: Agender
* Physical symbols: Heart (the actual organ)
* Likes: Their students
* Dislikes: People that try to date them after being rebuffed

Pollidisiac is the ideal partner for many: attractive, intelligent, funny, and
passionate. They are fascinated with sexuality, going as far as to get a Ph. D in it.

However, Pollidisiac is actually asexual. They work as a researcher at a top-level
university, and teach classes on sexuality. One of their favorite things is when students
come into class on day 1 snickering and joking about the course content, but by the end of
the semester can hold mature and respectful conversations about the topic.
  
## Clayconia
* Gender: Very precisely blended portions of masculinity, femininity, and flower
* Physical symbols: Play-Doh
* Likes: Beaches, sandboxes, yoga, symmetry
* Dislikes: Nonsymmetric or unbalanced things

Clayconia is the local elementary schoolchild who is the master of the sandbox. They're
able to create mindblowingly intricate and complex sandcastles, whether on the sandbox or
the beach.

Strangely, Clayconia doesn't think much about these. Their real focus is on modeling with
clay. Play-Doh is the most readily available type available, though they hope to get into
professional pottery once they get into high school.

Clayconia also has an uncannily strange obsession with yoga. They have been enamored with
it at an early age, and constantly ramble to their parents about their goal of achieving
perfect *balance*.

## Loonium
* Gender: They buried it in Alaska but won't tell us where
* Physical symbols: treasure chest
* Likes: Geocaching, MIT puzzle hunt
* Dislikes: Misplacing or having their items stolen

Loonium is a chronic hoarder, collecting any and all sort of trinkets and treasures,
regardless of value. They frequently procure new items from the dungeons Entropinnyum
visits, and trades them with the other flowers. Occasionally, Loonium will hide some of
their more valuable treasures and design elaborate treasure hunts for others.

Loonium has an incredible memory, and can recall at a moment's notice the location of an
item. For this reason, they also serve as the owner of a run-down thrift store, where
essentially any item can be acquired at extremely low price...as long as you can find it
inside the chaotically messy store.

## Daffomill
* Gender: Fan
* Physical symbols: East Asian paper fan
* Likes: K-Pop, V-Tubers, Fashion
* Dislikes: Antis of whatever they like at the moment

Daffomill is always chasing the latest trends. They were one of the first users of Vine,
was into K-Pop and Chinese animation before either was cool, and was the one that dragged
their friends onto BrikBlok.

This shouldn't come as a surprise, as Daffomill's day job is a social media
manager. Daffomill has uncannily deep knowledge about whatever they're obsessed with at
the moment, and are the go-to reference for any one who's out of the loop with the latest
memes.

Their dream is to attend every single concert of the international tour of their favorite
Korean boyband, BTS (Big Tater Squad).

## Vinculotus
* Gender: Can science be a gender?
* Physical symbols: Ender Pearl
* Likes: Magitech
* Dislikes: Dust mites and other pests

Vinculotus had always been known as an eccentric, borderline mad scientist, toiling away
in their forest home in search of a Grand Unified Theory of all physics.

However, ever since their run-in with the tall and slender beings that had appeared near
their science lab, their life was forever changed.

The mysterious gems that those beings dropped when they were slain shattered Vinculotus'
theories. Normally, this would have sent Vinculotus into a depressive bout for the next
year or so, but with this discovery Vinculotus discovered a world of dark magic beyond
their wildest dreams. The energies of the very void itself could be harnessed itself to
rip holes in space-time, travel large distances immediately, and even resurrect living
beings.

Drunken in this newfound knowledge, Vinculotus set about at once to integrate this magic
into their scientific frameworks and technological mechanisms. Day by day, night by night,
they toiled.

One day, this power would enable Vinculotus to act as he pleased, to be god. Vinculotus
was sure of this.

Little did Vinculotus realize that their mind was already well on its path towards the
descent to madness.

## Spectranthemum
* Gender: Magical Girl
* Physical symbols: Her Peperuto Poron (a flashy cyan wand), top hat
* Likes: Bnuuy, spreading positivity through magic
* Dislikes: Using magic for evil, her audience not having a good time

In contrast to many flowers who are only mere stage magicians -- playing tricks and cheap
sleights of hand on a stage -- or witches who are dedicated solely to their craft -- hunkering
in their lairs over bubbling cauldrons, Magical Girl Spectranthemum walks the line between
stage magic and witchcraft as a jack of both trades.

To the public, she is a world-famous stage magician, known for her stunning and
electrifying performances. You won't see tired old tricks like guessing the card in
someone's hand, or pulling bunnies out of a hat from her!

Likewise, to the magical world, she is a bit of an odd specimen, preferring to roam the
world, helping those in need that she encounters, instead of holing up and studying
alchemy, potions, and other witchcraft in vain pursuit of eternal youth.

She is wickedly intelligent, and melds true magic into her stage magic deftly to please
the crowd, while also taking lessons from stage magic into her studies as a magical girl
to make the world a place with more happiness and joy. Her talent has earned her great
adoration in both circles, though she does not reveal her dual lives to most.

In an increasingly specialized world, Spectranthemum is proof that being a well-rounded
generalist can still work out.

## Medumone
* Gender:
* Physical symbols:
* Likes:
* Dislikes: 

(slows mobs down)

## Marimorphosis
* Gender:
* Physical symbols:
* Likes:
* Dislikes: 

Idea: Alchemist (but a modern nuclear scientist)

## Bubbell
* Gender: Female (she/her)
* Physical symbols: Full-body plastic bubbles
* Likes: Social distancing, going to the spa, solo scuba diving, chatting with Hydroangea over IRC
* Dislikes: Parties

An easy misconception is that Bubbell has a bright and bubbly personality, due to their
name. In actuality, Bubbell is quite antisocial and avoids contact with most
others. Bubbell spends their spare time at home watching dramas and chatting with internet
friends, though they are careful to not reveal too much about themselves. (TODO needs
refinement and distinguishing characteristics with Hydro)

## Solegnolia
* Gender: Pronouns are thor/thom/thors (Solegnolia Really Likes Thor)
* Physical symbols: Any of the symbols that go on a circuit diagram
* Likes: Technical Minecraft, very niche modded Minecraft (Reika's ElectriCraft is a
  particular favorite), Simping for Fourier, Jamming with Bergamute
* Dislikes: Most of modded Minecraft (too easy)

Electricity is Solegnolia's *thing*. Having taken Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism by
the time thor were 12 years old, and graduated from MIT with a degree in Physics by 16,
Solegnolia seemed destined for a career amongst the stars of the field.

After several years in the "publish or perish" grind of academia, Solegnolia decided that
thor had had enough, and went on a sabbatical to truly think about what thor wanted out of
life. One day, at a hole-in-the-wall pub, Solegnolia met Rannuncarpus, a professional
pianist. Rannuncarpus was interested in expanding their horizons from classical music to
electronic, disco, rock, and other forms of piano music, and just happened to need an
electronics and sound engineer.

Solegnolia's strong theoretical foundations were an incredible superpower, and the two
quickly hit it off, with Solegnolia's unique tuning and Rannuncarpus' raw skill the
perfect combination to fill the void left in the music world from Daybloom, Nightshade,
and Hydroangeas' departure several years prior.

A rising star was now on the horizon.

## Bergamute
* Gender: Male (he/him)
* Physical symbols: Earmuffs
* Likes: The "lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to" YouTube livestream, frugality
* Dislikes: noise, greed, waste

Bergamute has "mute" in their name, but they actually love music. Bergamute strives their
hardest to keep life simple and free of unnecessary things. They speak rarely, but their
friends and coworkers listen and take Bergamute seriously when they do do so.

Bergamute is a music composer, not making much money, but enough to live on, and Bergamute
is completely satisfied with that.


# Botania Advancement References

Each Botania advancement visible in the advancements tab is actually a reference to a
Vocaloid song.

Vocaloid is a vocal synthesis engine whereby samples of a human's voice are recorded, then
reassembled to synthesize new audio of the voice. In ACG culture, Vocaloid is often used
to create original songs and covers of other songs. The compiled voice-banks are
anthropomorphized and given an avatar and name.

Here is a table of all the Botania advancements and the Vocaloid song they refer to,
provided as links to the Vocaloid song database VocaDB.

WARNING: Some songs are 18+ and inappropriate for children.
